 The nomenclature for genetically engineered mouse models is extensive \citeref{mgi13, mgi14}. This thesis will use the following simplified notation: \gene{Ptch1}\high{-/-} is homozygous mutant, \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-} is heterozygous mutant, and \gene{Ptch}\high{+/+} is homozygous wildtype at the \gene{Ptch} locus. The (+) symbol denotes a wildtype or non-mutated allele, and the (-) symbol denotes a null or loss-of-function allele. Multiple genetic modifications are separated by a semicolon: \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-};\gene{Trp53}\high{+/-} is heterozygous mutant for both \gene{Ptch} and \gene{Trp53}. While these notations omit the mouse strain, the genetic background of the mouse model can indeed modulate the mutant phenotype \citeref{pazzaglia02b, pazzaglia04, pazzaglia09}.
 
-Gene function may be disrupted constitutively (\emphterm{knocked out}). Homozygous knock-outs, which abrogates gene function completely, may cause embryonic lethaltiy and precludes further study (e.g. \gene{Ptch1}\high{-/-} mice die before birth) \citeref{goodrich97}. In addition to studying heterozygous knock-outs (e.g. \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-}), researchers may also conditionally disrupt of gene function using Cre recombination. A sequence flanked by loxP sites is knocked into the native gene locus. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and recombines the DNA, causing deletion of the region \emphterm{f}lanked by \emphterm{lox}P sites (the region is \emphterm{floxed} and subsequently deleted). Whenever and wherever Cre is expressed, the floxed region of the gene would be deleted. Such a model requires two genetic contructs: the floxed gene (e.g. \gene{Ptch1}\high{flx/flx} where flx denotes `floxed') and Cre with a promoter (e.g. \gene{Atoh1-Cre}). The floxed region may encompass the entire gene or (usually) critical exons of the gene so that the no functional products would result from the recombined gene. The promoter is often named after the gene from which it was derived. That is, \gene{Atoh1-Cre} indicates that Cre is placed downstream of the promoter for \gene{Atoh1} (and not the coding sequence of the \gene{Atoh1} gene itself). Therefore, in the \gene{Atoh1-Cre};\gene{Ptch1}\high{flx/flx} mouse \citeref{yang08}, Cre would be expressed in Atoh1-expressing cells and delete both of the floxed \gene{Ptch1} alleles; consequently, the Atoh1-expressing cells would incur a homozygous deletion of \gene{Ptch1} and lose Ptch1 function completely.

 A transgenic construct may also be integrated (randomly) into the genome to express a gene. For example, the \gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{+/W539L} mouse has the \gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{W539L} construct integrated into the genome once (later mapped to chr14) \citeref{hatton08}, the activated Smo (with a substitution mutation from tryptophan to leucine at residue 539) is expressed under the promoter of \gene{Neurod2}. The Cre recombination system may also be used to conditonally express a gene using a more complex design, such as the \gene{CAGGS-CreER};\gene{Rosa26-SMO}\high{W535L} mouse \citeref{mao06}. In this mouse, the human \gene{SMO} gene with an activating W535L mutation is knocked into the ubiquitously expressed \gene{Rosa26} locus, whose official symbol is Gt(ROSA)26Sor. (This human \gene{SMO} gene is known as SmoM2 \citeref{xie98} and corresponds to mouse \gene{Smo}\high{W539L}, which is known as SmoA1 \citeref{hallahan04}.) However, since a floxed polyadenylation stop sequence cassette is placed upstream of the \gene{SMO}\high{W535L} gene, the latter is only expressed subsequent to Cre-mediated deletion of the cassette. Cre is expressed here under the synthetic CAGGS promoter (which drives high-level, generalized expression), and its activity is (somewhat) tamoxifen-dependent because it is fused to the estrogen receptor. Therefore, the expression of \gene{SMO}\high{W535L} is ultimately controlled by the administration of tamoxifen (at least in design).

 %		Shh signaling pathway.
 		GLI transcription factors, including GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3, are downstream effectors of \gls{shh} signaling. The proteome can completely degrade GLI proteins or proteolytically process them into activators or repressors forms, depending on post-translational modifications on the full-length GLI proteins. GLI1 and GLI2 predominantly function in the activator form and activates transcription, while GLI3 mainly functions in the repressor form and represses transcription. \gls{shh} signaling modulates the marks on full-length GLI, thereby influencing downstream transcription.
 		In the absence of SHH ligand, SMO activity is repressed by PTCH. Upon SHH binding to PTCH, this repression is relieved, leading to active SMO signaling, which favours the processing of GLI into the active form; consequently, transcription of target genes including cell cycle genes (\gene{CCND1} and \gene{CCNE1}), \gene{MYC}, and negative regulators of Shh signaling (\gene{PTCH1} and \gene{HHIP}) is induced.
-		The precise mechanism whereby SMO (indirectly) activates GLI is not conserved between fly and mammals and remains unknown in mammals. Four proteins bind to and regulate GLI processing: KIF7, SUFU, SPOP, and BTRC. Both KIF7 and SUFU are negative regulators of Shh signaling via unclear mechanisms. The role of SUFU remains contentious; possible roles include: nuclear export of GLI, protection of GLI from degradation, recruitment of GLI3 for processing into the repressor form. Conversely, SPOP and BTRC ($\beta$TRCP) serve to recognize GLI and they function as subunits of E3 ligase complexes, which mark (by ubiquitination) GLI for proteolytic processing by the proteome. The CUL1 containing complex is also known as the Skp, Collin1, F-box (SCF) complex, Via BTRC-mediated recognition, this complex ubiquitinates many other proteins, including CTNNB1 from the Wnt pathway.

 \section{Classification}
 \label{sec:classification}
 
-Classification is the central preoccupation of one of the oldest discipline, taxonomy, which seeks to place organisms into groups based on shared characteristics. Just as classifying organisms facilitates their study, classifying diseases also helps clinicians understand common mechanisms underlying disease and develop rational treatment against each type of disease. Classification encompasses two parts: first, the classes are established by exploring features and grouping the samples based on similarity of features; second, a method is created to classify new sample using features that discriminate between classes. In bioinformatics, the first part is referred to as \emphterm{class discovery}, and the second, \emphterm{class prediction}. In taxonomy, the term \emphterm{classification} only refers to the first part while the term \emphterm{identification} refers to the second part. In machine learning, the first part is equivalent to \emphterm{unsupervised learning}, and the second, \emphterm{supervised learning}. In statistics, the term \emphterm{classification} only refers to the second part. Notwithstanding the different terminologies in various fields and the conflation of different meanings of the term `classification', the two components have distinct objectives. While some algorithms can be used for both class discovery and class prediction, algorithms specifically designed for prediction usually outperform other algorithms in the class prediction problem. Furthermore, class prediction algorithms are well developed for the case in which the classes are known for a set of samples. Conversely, the class discovery process may be contentious: when using different features results in discovering different sets of classes, which set of classes is correct? Indeed, a classification system is practically useful insofar as it is widely accepted and stable. Once such a classification system is discovered and becomes established, one can focus on predicting the class of a new sample (as least until a new classification system arises).

 Another challenge of clustering analysis is to determine the number of classes represented in the data, $k$. Some algorithms begin by putting all samples into one class and proceed to partition the samples into smaller classes recursively (e.g. divisive hierarchical clustering), some algorithms begin by putting each sample into its own class and proceed to cluster the samples into bigger classes recursively (e.g. agglomerative hierarchical clustering). Either way, a decision must be made as to when to stop partitioning or clustering. In the case of hierarchical clustering, this decision is usually made informally. Other algorithms require the number of classes $k$ to be specified \emph{a priori} (e.g. $k$-means, finite mixture models). One recent algorithm that circumvents this requirement is \emphterm{Dirichlet Process infinite mixture model}, which allows for all possible values of $k$ and discovers $k$ from the data. However, Dirichlet Process can be very computationally intensive. An alternative approach is evaluate the clustering results for different values of $k$. (For algorithms in which $k$ is not specified \emph{a prior}, one runs the algorithm until $k$ clusters are created.)
 
-There is no census on the best method for evaluating the quality of the clusters. Often, practitioners evaluate clustering results by considering external information. This external evaluation of the data should be done with care in order to avoid overfitting and optimistic bias. Additionally, since the objective of class discovery is to discover new classes, comparison with known classes would not likely help guide the evaluation of clustering results. As an example, suppose we evaluate clustering results by assessing the association of the discovered classes with survival (i.e. how different are the survival times among the classes). Using this criterion, we compare the association with survival among different clustering algorithms or parameter settings, and we choose the algorithm with the parameter setting that achieves the most significant association with survival. Unless we have additional samples not used during clustering to validate the association of the classes with survival, we may be \emph{overfitting} the algorithm (or parameters) to the existing data, and the optimistically biased association may disappear in a new dataset. In other words, we may have discovered classes that are spuriously associated with survival in our available data, and we may not observe this association again in a new dataset. We may mitigate this problem by using a subset of the data for optimizing the clustering algorithm and evaluating the results on the remaining data. Alternatively, we may also evaluate the clustering results without using external data. This internal evaluation of the data involves measuring the distance between sample pairs within each cluster as well as the distance between sample pairs from different clusters. The best cluster assignments should minimize the within-cluster distance and maximize the between-cluster distance. Different measures for evaluating and combining these two objectives have been proposed, including the silhouette width and the Dunn index. However, these internal measures depend on the definition of distance between samples: the results would change if a different distance measure were used. Indeed, evaluating the results of a clustering algorithm can be difficult and far from straightforward. Due to this difficulty in evaluating clustering results, there is also no census on the best clustering method. There is simply no substitute for applying class discovery on different datasets and confirming that the same classes are discovered in each dataset.

 \subsection{Class prediction}
 
-Given a set of samples with known classes (\emphterm{labeled data}), the objective of class prediction is to learn the association between the labels and the features of the samples and subsequently predict the class of a new sample. The classes labels could be defined by expert opinion, discovered by systematic clustering, or determined by other means. Class prediction involves three steps: \emphterm{training}, \emphterm{testing}, and \emphterm{application}. That is, a classifier must be trained on a labeled dataset and tested on another labeled dataset before it can be applied on samples with unknown classes (\emphterm{unlabeled data}). During training, the classifier learns the association between labels and features in a first labeled dataset (\emphterm{training data}). During testing, we evaluate how well the classifier generalizes its learned association to a separate labeled dataset (\emphterm{testing data}). Finally, only when we are certain that the classifier can predict classes accurately, we apply it to unknown samples and make downstream decisions.

 One simple measure of classifier performance is \emphterm{accuracy}: the percentage of samples classified correctly. A high accuracy on the training data indicates the classifier has sufficient capacity to learn from the data, and a high accuracy on the testing data implies that the classifier can generalize well. When a classifier has high training accuracy but low testing accuracy, the classifier is likely overfitted to the training data. In such an event, possible remedies include simplifying the complexity of the classification algorithm (by permitting fewer free parameters) or collect more training data.
 
-For a classification problem with two classes (positive and negative), common evaluation methods include receiver-operating characteristics curve or precision-recall curve. These methods simultaneously evaluate how often a classifier falsely assign a positive label to a true negative sample and how often a classifier falsely assign a negative label to a true positive sample. For multiclass problems, common evaluation methods include Rand index or Jaccard index. Alternatively, a multiclass problem can be split into multiple two-class sub-problems, in which each sub-problem addresses whether a sample belongs to a given class.

-One in 285 children are diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20, and cancer is the second leading cause of death in children \citeref{ward14, murphy13}. Owing to advances in treatment, the 5-year survival of children with cancer has steadily increased from 63\% in 1975 to 85\% in 2006 \citeref{howlader14}. Improvements in survival, however, vary considerably across cancer types. In 1975, the 5-year survival rates for childhood leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour were 50\% and 57\%, respectively. In 2006, the survival rate for the former reached 87\% while the latter lagged behind at 74\% \citeref{howlader14}. Indeed, leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour are biologically very different types of cancer: they arise from different cells within different organs, hijack different cellular signaling programs to effect uncontrolled proliferation, and reside in different locations with different accessibilities to treatment. It should come as no surprise then that leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour respond differently to similar modern anti-cancer treatments (consisting of chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Furthermore, leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour can each be classified into additional cancer subtypes, which also response varyingly to treatment. Within leukemias, the 5-year patient survival of acute lymphocytic leukemia is 92\% and that of acute myelogenous leukemia is 66\% \citeref{howlader14}. Within \gls{cns} tumours, the 5-year patient survival of pilocytic astrocytoma is 94\% and that of medulloblastoma is 72\% \citeref{ostrom14}. In general, the responses of cancers to therapy depend on not only the affected tissue (blood vs.\ \gls{cns}) but also the cellular origin (lymphoid vs.\ myeloid and astrocytic vs.\ embryonal). Using anatomical locations and cellular appearance, clinicians classify cancer into different types in order to predict the responses to treatment. Current post-surgical treatment modalities eradicate cancer largely by one predominant mechanism (inhibiting cellular division and inducing apoptosis), but novel anti-cancer therapies are increasing in specificity against aberrant cells and diverging in mechanisms of action. Accordingly, the classification of cancer with progressively finer granularity will become critical for selecting the right treatment for each patient.

-While the current classification of cancer using the primary site of occurrence and the morphology of the cell have been useful for predicting patient response, the advent of molecular profiling and sequencing technologies can refine this classification further and facilitate the development of therapies targeted against specific aberrations within a cancer. The \gls{who}, in its current classification of \gls{cns} tumours published in 2007, classifies \gls{cns} tumours into 86 distinct entities based primarily on histological appearance \citeref{who07}. In comparison, \gls{who} recognized \emph{only} 36 subtypes of \gls{cns} tumours in 1993 \citeref{kleihues93}. Despite the more detailed classification system, the 5-year survival of children with \gls{cns} tumours has remained stagnant at about 75\% since 1996 \citeref{howlader14}. This discrepancy between the discovery of new \gls{cns} tumour histotypes and the lack of therapeutic improvement over the past decade suggest that the histological classification of \gls{cns} tumours may be insufficient to identify biologically similar tumours and to facilitate the development of novel effective therapy. In particular, it was noted as early as 1971 that medulloblastoma with desmoplastic histology exhibits longer patient survival in response to radiotherapy \citeref{chatty71}; however, it remains unclear why the desmoplastic phenotype is associated with longer survival or which novel therapeutic agent may be effective against this histological variant. In comparison, a medulloblastoma tumour with a loss-of-function mutation in \gene{PTCH1} (endogenous suppressor of \gls{shh} signaling) would depend on hyperactive \gls{shh} signaling for growth, the patient would therefore be expected to --- and indeed does --- respond to inhibition of \gls{shh} signaling \citeref{rudin09}. Characterizing the genetic mutations and understanding the biology of a tumour can therefore help guide the discovery of novel therapies and the selection of suitable treatment modality or intensity.
+While the current classification of cancer based on organ system and cell morphology has been useful for predicting patient response, the advent of molecular profiling and sequencing technologies can refine this classification further and facilitate the development of therapies targeted against specific aberrations within cancer. The \gls{who}, in its current classification of \gls{cns} tumours published in 2007, classifies \gls{cns} tumours into 86 distinct entities primarily using histological appearance \citeref{who07}. In comparison, \gls{who} recognized \emph{only} 36 subtypes of \gls{cns} tumours in 1993 \citeref{kleihues93}. Despite a more detailed classification system, the 5-year survival of children with \gls{cns} tumours has remained stagnant at about 75\% since 1996 \citeref{howlader14}. Although histological features can help identify aggressive cancers, the discrepancy between the discovery of new \gls{cns} tumour histotypes and the lack of therapeutic improvement over the past decade suggests that the histological classification of \gls{cns} tumours may be insufficient to identify biologically similar tumours and to facilitate the development of effective novel therapy. In particular, it was noted as early as 1971 that medulloblastoma with desmoplastic histology exhibits longer patient survival in response to radiotherapy \citeref{chatty71}; however, it remains unclear why the desmoplastic phenotype is associated with longer survival or which novel therapeutic agent may be effective against this histological variant.

-In order to identify cancer mutations against which therapeutic intervention may be beneficial, we would need to distinguish between mutations that contribute to tumourigenesis (known as \emphterm{driver} mutations) from those that do not (known as \emphterm{passenger} mutations). Cancer cells accumulate somatic mutations by disrupting DNA damage response or DNA repair pathways. Moreover, somatic mutations, in general, occur stochastically (with some exceptions including antibody diversification by activation-induced cytidine deaminase). Thus, most mutations in a cancer cell would be deleterious or neutral to the cell, and mutations that confer selective advantage would increase in \emphterm{cellular frequency} (proportion of cells habouring the mutation) within a tumour. There are two caveats, however. First, not all mutations observed at high cellular frequency contribute to tumourigenesis. Since multiple mutations may occur each time a cancer cell replicate its DNA and multiple cell divisions may occur before a new driver mutation arises, a population of cancer cells arising from the same parental cell will share one driver mutation and many additional mutations that do not contribute to tumourigenesis. Second, not all driver mutations become clonal (i.e. reach 100\% cellular frequency) due to complex cell-cell interactions. In glioblastoma multiforme, for example, cancer cells expressing mutant EGFR secrete cytokines to promote the growth of cells expressing wild-type EGFR \citeref{inda10}; hence, tumour heterogeneity in glioblastoma can be sustained by this paracrine mechanism and the \gene{EGFR} mutation does not become clonal. Taking these two scenarios into consideration, high cellular frequency is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a mutation to be a driver. Instead, an alternative, more robust method for distinguish driver from passenger mutations would be to assess its \emphterm{recurrence frequency}: the frequency that a mutation is observed across samples. If a mutation drives tumour formation, we would expect to find it across tumours from different patients, provided that the collection of tumours is biologically similar and arises through a common molecular mechanisms. Above all, in order to use recurrence frequency as a criteria for identifying driver mutations and recognizing genomic patterns, we would need to first classify the tumours into molecularly homogeneous groups.

-This thesis will focus on the refining the classification of \emphterm{medulloblastoma}, a malignant brain tumour occurring in the cerebellum and the posterior fossa. \gls{who} classifies medulloblastoma as a grade IV (highly aggressive) embryonal tumour \citeref{who07}. Its diagnosis is made by the anatomical location of the tumour and the histological morphology of the cells. Medulloblastoma was once a universally fatal disease; today, 58\% of patients are expected to live longer than 15 years \citeref{ward14}. To predict whether a patient will respond favourably to treatment, clinicians currently categorize medulloblastoma by such features as metastatic presentation and histological variants. Medulloblastoma may be divided into classic, desmoplastic/nodular, and large cell/anaplastic histotypes. While this histological classification of medulloblastoma provides some prognostic value, it provide scant insight into potential biological mechanisms. Therefore, several studies generated RNA expression profiles of primary medulloblastoma tumours using microarrays and sought to characterize medulloblastoma by patterns of RNA expression. Since each expression profile captures a snapshot of the overall molecular state of a tumour, biologically similar tumours would exhibit similar expression profiles. Therefore, tumours with similar expression profiles can be \emphterm{clustered} (grouped) together to discover biologically homogeneous molecular classes. By these clustering analyses, four molecular classes (henceforth known as \emphterm{subgroups}) of medulloblastoma were discovered: \emphterm{WNT}, \emphterm{SHH}, \emphterm{Group3}, and \emphterm{Group4} medulloblastoma \citeref{taylor12, northcott11a, kool12, remke11, cho11}. As the names suggest, WNT medulloblastoma have hyperactive \gls{wnt} signaling and SHH medullobalstoma have increased \gls{shh} signaling compared to the other subgroups, while Group3 and Group4 are less well defined \citeref{northcott11a, kool12, cho11}. \textbf{We hypothesize that classifying medulloblastoma into these molecular subgroups will shed light on its cancer biology; consequently, this classification will improve prediction of treatment response and point to novel therapeutic targets.}

 \section{Epidemiology and genetic predisposition}
 
-Medulloblastoma occurs at an annual incidence of 4.1 per million children under 20, ranking as the most common type of malignant brain tumour in childhood \citeref{ostrom14}. The majority of patients with medulloblastoma are diagnosed before the age of 20, and the median age at presentation is 8 years \citeself{shih14}. As medulloblastoma is almost 10 more likely to afflict children than adults, medulloblastoma is a disease of childhood \citeref{smoll12}, suggesting perhaps genetics may play a role in this disease. Consistent with this proposition, medulloblastoma can occur simultaneously in monozygotic twins \citeref{scheurlen96}, and having an affected sibling increases a child's risk of developing medulloblastoma by 4 fold \citeref{hemminki09}. While most medulloblastoma cases are sporadic with unknown genetic contribution, several genetic disorders can predispose children to developing medulloblastoma, as well as many other malignancies (\citetab{genetic-disorders}). For instance, mutations in genes of DNA damage response and repair pathways, including \gene{TP53}, \gene{ATM}, \gene{BRAC2}, \gene{NBN}, predispose a child to develop a spectrum of tumours, including medulloblastoma, at a young age \citeref{pearson82, barel98, guran99, yamazaki00, garre09, villani11, hart87, reiman11, offit03, hirsch04, reid05, dewire09, ciara10, alexiou12}.

 Medulloblastoma can also arise as a consequence of germline mutations in developmental signaling pathways. Germline loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators of \gls{shh} signaling, including \gene{PTCH1}, \gene{PTCH2}, and \gene{SUFU}, causes basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) and predisposes patients to medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma (most common type of skin cancer), and other cancers. In the context of these mutations, hyperactive \gls{shh} signaling during neural development presumably would cause patients to develop SHH medulloblastoma. This notion is supported by mouse models with heterozygous \gene{Ptch1} mutation \citeref{goodrich97, wetmore00, wetmore01, pazzaglia02, gibson10} and the \gene{Sufu}\high{+/-} \gene{Trp53}\high{-/-} mouse model \citeref{heby-henricson12}, which both develop medulloblastoma with active Shh signaling. Further, Gorlin syndrome is highly prevalent in human patients with SHH medulloblastoma \citeref{kool14}, though it is yet unclear whether patients with Gorlin syndrome exclusively develop SHH medullobalstoma. Additionally, germline mutations in \gene{APC} activates \gls{wnt} signaling, manifests as Turcot syndrome, and predisposes patients to medulloblastoma. The tumours arising in these patients would be expected to be of the WNT subgroup; however, the crosstalk between the \gls{shh} and the \gls{wnt} signaling pathways in the context of neural development and different genetic backgrounds could modulate the phenotypic outcome of \gene{APC} mutation.
 
-Germline mutations in \gene{SMARCB1} (\gene{SNF5}/\gene{INI}) had been associated with medulloblastoma \citeref{sevenet99, lee02}, but brain tumours in these patients are now classified as \gls{atrt}, a tumour type that \gls{who} first recognized in its 1993 classification \citeref{kleihues93}. \gls{atrt} and medulloblastoma are similar by histology\citeref{utsuki03} and by \gls{mri} \citeref{koral08}. Currently, \gene{SMARCB1} mutation is widely accepted as an diagnostic indicator of \gls{atrt} and distinguishes \gls{atrt} from medulloblastoma \citeref{biegel00, kraus02}. Indeed, \gene{SMARCB1} is an example in which a genetic mutation superseded histological diagnosis and redefined cancer classification.

-While mutations are pivotal factors in the formation of medulloblastoma, numerous other factors shape the context under which the mutations exert their effects. The genetic mutations listed in \citetab{genetic-disorders} all have incomplete penetrance, highlighting the contribution of genetic background (as well as environmental factors). Furthermore, disparate incidence patterns of mouse tumours arising from engineered mutations in negative regulators of the \gls{shh} signaling pathway (\gene{SUFU} and \gene{PTCH1}) point to several possible contributing factors, including the limitation of inbred mouse models, involvement of genes in multiple biological pathways, and potential modifying genetic polymorphisms or mutations. On the C57BL/6 genetic background, \gene{SUFU}\high{+/-} mice do not develop medulloblastoma within the same time frame as \gene{PTCH1}\high{+/-} mice, even though both \gene{SUFU} and \gene{PTCH1} negatively regulate Shh signaling \citeref{svard09}. Conversely, in a Manchester cohort of 171 Gorlin syndrome patients, germline \gene{SUFU} mutation had about 20 times higher risk than germline \gene{PTCH1} mutation of developing medulloblastoma \citeref{smith14}. The observation that only 2 (1.7\%; $n = 115$) Manchester patients with \gene{PTCH1} mutation developed medulloblastoma \citeref{smith14} starkly contrasts the findings in inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6 and 129X1/Sv) with \gene{PTCH1} mutation, which spontaneously develop medulloblastoma at a frequency of about 18\% ($n = 507$; \citetab{ptch1-mmu-mb}) \citeref{goodrich97, wetmore00, svard09, pazzaglia09}. The difference in the penetrances of mutations in \gene{SUFU} vs.\ \gene{PTCH1} suggests that these genes may have other functions beyond \gls{shh} pathway or they regulate the pathway in dissimilar manners. However, the inversion in the relative penetrances of \gene{SUFU} and \gene{PTCH1} mutations in a human population compared to mouse models suggest that polymorphisms or mutations in possible modifier genes may influence the manifestation of mutant \gene{SUFU} and \gene{PTCH1}. Alternatively, this observation may indicate that the \gls{shh} signaling pathway regulate neural development in critically different ways in mouse and human. Accordingly, these possibilities prompts the need for further studies in additional human populations and mouse strains in order to tease out the intricate interplay between mutant genes and genetic background.

-The phenotypic manifestation of genetic mutations is also influenced by the state of the mutation-harbouring cells. \gene{PTEN} (endogenous inhibitor of \gls{pi3k} signaling) is frequently homozygously deleted in medulloblastoma \citeref{northcott09}, suggesting that \gene{PTEN} may be a tumour supressor. Heterozygous germline \gene{PTEN} mutation, however, leads to adult tumours (PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome) but not medulloblastoma \citeref{tan12}. Instead, one mutant copy of \gene{PTEN} leads to Lhermitte-Duclos disease, which presents as a benign tumour of the cerebellum \citeref{zhou03}. The cells in the tumour have complete loss of wildtype \gene{PTEN} expression \citeref{zhou03}. Curiously, the granule neurons exhibit dysplasia (disorganization of tissue structure), increased size, aberrant migration, but not abnormal cellular proliferation \citeref{endersby08}, in contrast to neoplastic neurons in medulloblastoma. This example illustrates that the cell state during nervous system development influences whether the cells progresses to neoplasia (cancer). In the case of \gene{PTEN}, other mutations would need to co-occur with \gene{PTEN} loss-of-function in order for patients to develop medulloblastoma. Indeed, patients with germline \gene{PTEN} and \gene{Pten}\high{+/-} mice do not develop malignant brain tumours, despite predisposition to various other tumours \citeref{endersby08}. In contrast to \gene{Pten} loss alone, concomitant overexpression of SHH (human protein) causes medulloblastoma in mouse following irradiation \citeref{hambardzumyan08}. More generally, the effect of a mutant gene is modulated by the state of the cell harbouring the mutation, and this state can be shaped by genetic background, cooperating mutations, and developmental signaling. As a cell mature and differentiate down various lineages during development, it may reach a state that permits a specific mutation (germline or somatic) to transform it into cancer with supporting signals from the surrounding microenvironment.

 \subsection{\gls{wnt} signaling}
 
-Patients with Turcot syndrome (mutation in \gene{APC}) who developed medulloblastoma provided the one of the first clues that medulloblastoma involves activation of \gls{wnt} signaling \citeref{hamilton95}. Additionally, CTNNB1 nuclear localization and \gene{CTNNB1} mutation were frequently observed medullobalstoma \citeref{thompson06, ellison05}. CTNNB1 is the transcriptional factor that serves as the downstream effector of \gls{wnt} signaling. As part of the CTNNB1 destruction complex containing AXIN and APC, GSK and CSNK1A1 normally phosphorylates CTNNB1 at multiple serine/threonine residues (S45, T41 S37, and S33) within a region encoded by exon 3, flagging CTNNB1 for ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation \citeref{liu02}. Mutation in APC therefore aborgates the interaction between the destruction complex and CTNNB1, preventing the degradation of CTNNB1. Similarly, CTNNB1 mutations at or near the phosphorylation sites also stabilizes CTNNB1, permitting its signaling \citeref{liu02, legoix99, shih12}. Curiously, a mouse model expressing stabilized human (S37F mutant) CTNNB1 under the mouse promoter of \gene{Prnp} did not develop medulloblastoma on a \gene{Trp53}\high{-/-} background \citeref{kratz02}. Conversely, Gibson \emph{et al.}\ generated medullobalstoma using a different mouse model expressing stabilized CTNNB1 \citeref{gibson10}. In this Cre-recombination model, mouse \gene{Ctnnb1} is converted to a stabilized form by Cre-mediated somatic deletion of exon 3 (which was flanked by loxP sequences) \citeref{harada99}. \gene{Ctnnb1} is under endogenous promoter control, but deletion of exon 3 is controlled by expressing Cre under a selected promoter; therefore, expression of stabilized Ctnnb1 can be restricted to cell types that activate the selected promoter.  \gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)} mice crossed to \gene{Atoh1-Cre} mice did not produce progeny (\gene{Atoh1-Cre};\gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)}) that develop hyperplasia or medulloblastoma, suggesting that Atoh1-expressing cells are not the developmental origin of Wnt-activated medulloblastoma \citeref{gibson10}. In contrast, \gene{Blbp-Cre};\gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)} mice showed hyperplasia in the dorsal brainstem and eventually developed medulloblastoma in the context of \gene{Trp53} deficiency, which presumably caused additional tumourigenic mutations or inhibited apoptosis \citeref{gibson10}. In sum, only \gene{Blbp-Cre};\gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)};\gene{Trp53}\high{flx/flx} mouse developed Wnt-activated medulloblastoma, and these tumours arise from the dorsal brainstem and not the cerebellum (in contrast to the Shh-activated medulloblastoma described later). Tumour development not only required expression of the oncogene (stablized \gene{Ctnnb1}) in a suitable cell type (Blbp-expressing) but may also need additional mutations (secondary to \gene{Trp53} deletion).

In this Cre-recombination model, mouse \gene{Ctnnb1} is converted to a stabilized form by Cre-mediated somatic deletion of exon 3 (which was flanked by loxP sequences) \citeref{harada99}. \gene{Ctnnb1} is under endogenous promoter control, but deletion of exon 3 is controlled by expressing Cre under a selected promoter; therefore, expression of stabilized Ctnnb1 can be restricted to cell types that activate the selected promoter.  \gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)} mice crossed to \gene{Atoh1-Cre} mice did not produce progeny (\gene{Atoh1-Cre};\gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)}) that develop hyperplasia or medulloblastoma, suggesting that Atoh1-expressing cells are not the developmental origin of Wnt-activated medulloblastoma \citeref{gibson10}. In contrast, \gene{Blbp-Cre};\gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)} mice showed hyperplasia in the dorsal brainstem and eventually developed medulloblastoma in the context of \gene{Trp53} deficiency, which presumably caused additional tumourigenic mutations or inhibited apoptosis \citeref{gibson10}. In sum, only \gene{Blbp-Cre};\gene{Ctnnb1}\high{+/lox(ex3)};\gene{Trp53}\high{flx/flx} mouse developed Wnt-activated medulloblastoma, and these tumours arise from the dorsal brainstem and not the cerebellum (in contrast to the Shh-activated medulloblastoma to be described later). Tumour development not only requires expression of the oncogene (stablized \gene{Ctnnb1}) in a suitable cell type (Blbp-expressing) but may also need additional mutations (secondary to \gene{Trp53} deletion).
 
 
 \subsection{\gls{shh} signaling}
 
-Medulloblastoma can also develop due to activated Shh signaling. Patients with Gorlin syndrome provided the first clue that \gls{shh} signaling is activated in a subset of medulloblastoma. Patients with germline loss-of-function mutations in negative regulators of \gls{shh} signaling --- \gene{PTCH1}, \gene{PTCH2}, or \gene{SUFU} --- can develop medullobastoma during childhood, and basal cell carcinoma and other tumours later in life due to hyperactive \gls{shh} signaling \citeref{wolter97, taylor02, crawford09, garre09, brugieres10, jones11, brugieres12}. Moreover, somatic \gene{PTCH1} mutation, activating \gene{SMO} mutation, \gene{PTCH1} homozygous deletions, \gene{GLI2} amplifications are recurrently observed in medulloblastoma tumours \citeref{raffel97, reifenberger98, northcott09, shih12}, which provide further evidence that \gls{shh} signaling is activated in some medulloblastoma cases. In mouse, homozygous \gene{Ptch1} loss is embryonic lethal, but heterozygous \gene{Ptch1} mutant mice exhibit hyperplasia in the external granule layer of the cerebellum, and a subset of mutant mice develop cerebellar medulloblastoma \citeref{goodrich97, wetmore00}. Frequently, the external granule layer of the developing cerebellum exhibit hyperplasia (cell mass with increased proliferation) before medulloblastoma \citeref{oliver05, yang08}. The incidence medulloblastoma in \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-} mice ranges from 8\% to 45\% and is influenced by the genetic background (\citetab{shh-mmu-mb}). (Additionally, the incidence of medulloblastoma in \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-} models is affected by the occurrence of rhabdomyosarcoma and other tumours whose early appearance may preclude the development of medulloblastoma \citeref{hahn98, goodrich97}.) This incomplete penetrance suggests that additional events beyond single-copy \gene{Ptch1} loss may be necessary for tumour progression. Indeed, \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-} mice developed tumours with much higher frequency in the context of \gene{Trp53} deficiency (\citetab{shh-mmu-mb}) and when subjected to neonatal irradiation, conditional on the genetic background (\citetab{ptch1-mmu-mb}). Presumably, \gene{Trp53} deficiency and irradiation generate additional mutation that cooperate with \gene{Ptch1} haploinsuffiency to promote progression of hyperplasia to medulloblastoma. Since \gene{APC} mutation did not enhance tumour incidence in \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-} mouse, the Wnt signalling pathway may not play a major role in the development of Shh-activated medulloblastoma \citeref{wetmore01}. Similarly, homozygous loss of mouse p19\high{ARF} did not enhance medulloblastoma formation in \gene{Ptch1}\high{+/-} mice \citeref{wetmore01}, suggesting that the hyperproliferation of external granule neuron precursors caused by activated \gls{shh} signaling does not trigger p19\high{ARF}-dependent cell cycle arrest. (Mouse p19\high{ARF} is encoded by \gene{Ckdn2a} and mediates p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, similar to the human homolog p14\high{ARF}.) In contrast, concurrent haploinsufficiency of either of two other cell cycle inhibitor, \gene{Cdkn2c} (encodes p18\high{Ink4c}) or \gene{Cdkn1b} (encodes p27\high{Kip1}), in \gene{Ptch1}{+/-} mice further increased cell proliferation and enhanced medulloblastoma incidence \citeref{uziel05, ayrault09}. The tumours in these mice invariably lost the wild-type copy of \gene{Ptch1} \citeref{uziel05, ayrault09}. Indeed, complete loss of \gene{Ptch1} is highly frequently observed in the medulloblastoma tumour and may a key event for medulloblastoma progression \citeref{berman02, pazzaglia06, oliver05, uziel05, ayrault09, mille14, frappart09}. Activated \gls{shh} signaling in \gene{Ptch1}\high{-/+} granule neuron precursors induces cellular proliferation and increases accumulation of DNA breaks, which can lead to the loss of the wildtype \gene{Ptch1} allele, further induction of \gls{shh}/Gli signaling independent of Shh ligand or Shh coreceptor Boc, and progression of medulloblastoma \citeref{mille14}. Although homozygous loss of \gene{Ptch1} is not absolutely required for progression of hyperplasia to medulloblastoma \citeref{wetmore00, zurawel00, mille14}, conditional homozygous loss in Atoh1-expressing cells (e.g. external granule neuron precursors) or GFAP-expressing cells (e.g. neural stem cells) is sufficient for developing medulloblastoma from the external granule layer with 100\% penetrance \citeref{yang08}. Similarly, activated Smo (inhibited target of Ptch1 and positive regulator of \gls{shh} signaling) induced tumour formation in a dose-dependent manner \citeref{hatton08}. When one copy of the activated mouse Smo allele habouring the W539L mutation (also known as SmoA1 and corresponds to the human SmoM2 allele) was expressed under the promoter of \gene{Neurod2} (which is expressed in cerebellar granule neuron precursors), the mice developed medulloblastoma with 48\% penetrance, and mice carrying two copies of the activated Smo allele (\gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{W539L/W539L}) develop medulloblastoma with near complete penetrance \citeref{hallahan04, hatton08}. Morever, GLI (downstream effector of \gls{shh} signaling) promotes cell survival by directly upregulating the prosurvival factor BCL2 \citeref{regl04, bar07} and disabling DNA damage checkpoint \citeref{leonard08}. These results support the notion that activated \gls{shh} signaling is suffient for medulloblastoma formation and may be necessary for tumour maintainence, highlighting this pathway as a candidate for therapuetic intervention.

 \subsection{Notch signaling}
 
-Notch signaling plays important roles in embryonic development; in the cental nervous system, Notch signaling prevents precocious neuronal differentiation and maintains the pluripotency and self-renewal of neural stem and progenitor cells \citeref{delapompa97, breunig07}. While \gene{Notch1}\high{+/-} mice are viable, homozygous \gene{Notch1} mutants die before E11.5 and possibly partly due to the depletion of neural stem cell pool \citeref{swiatek94, delapompa97, breunig07}. The embryonic lethality of \gene{Notch1}\high{-/-} also suggests that \gene{Notch1} is not completely functionally redundant with other mammalian Notch homologs (\gene{Notch2}, \gene{Notch3}, and \gene{Notch4}). Conversely, conditional activation of Notch signaling by transgenic expression of a constitutively active Notch, \gls{n1icd}, in \gene{GFAP-CreER};\gene{ACTB-N1ICD} blocked cell cycle exit of neural progenitors and inhibited neuronal differentiation \citeref{breunig07}. (In this model, \gene{N1ICD} is conditionally expressed by Cre excision of an upstream stop cassette.) Conceivably, hyperactive Notch signaling may promote tumour formation by blocking cell cycle exit and differentiation. Consistent with this proposition, Shh-activated medulloblastoma in \gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{+/W539L} mice show increased expression of Notch pathway targets (\gene{HES1} and \gene{HES5}) as well as \gene{Notch1}, suggesting that the Notch pathway is active in medulloblastoma induced by \gls{shh} signaling \citeref{hallahan04}. When \gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{+/W539L} were crossed to \gene{Atoh1-Cre};\gene{Notch1}\high{flx/flx} or \gene{Atoh1-Cre};\gene{Notch2}\high{flx/flx} mice, the progeny (\gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{+/W539L};\gene{Atoh1-Cre};\gene{Notch1}\high{flx/flx} and \gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{+/W539L};\gene{Atoh1-Cre};\gene{Notch2}\high{flx/flx}) did not develop medulloblastoma at a higher incidence \citeref{hatton10}. While the conditional knockout of one Notch homolog could perhaps be rescued by another homolog, treatment with multiple gamma-secretase inhibitors (which prevent Notch cleavage and activation) did not affect tumour incidence, tumour size, apoptosis, or cell proliferation in \gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{+/W539L} mice, nor did it affect xenograft engraftment in immunocompromised mice \citeref{hatton10}. Similarly, constitutive knockout of an important downstream target \gene{Hes5} in \gene{Neurod2-Smo}\high{+/W539L};\gene{Hes5}\high{-/-} mutants did not reduce medulloblastoma incidence either \citeref{hatton10}. Therefore, Notch signaling is not necessary for formation, progression, or maintenance of Shh-activated medulloblastoma \citeref{hatton10, julian10}.

The \gls{pi3k} family phosphorylates the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P\low{2}] to produce phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P\low{3} or PIP\low{3}] \citeref{cantley02}. In turn, PIP\low{3} serves as an intermediate signaling molecule for multiple pathways. AKT1 binds to PIP\low{3} via its pleckstrin-homology domain and becomes anchored to the plasma membrane by PIP\low{3}; consequently, PIP\low{3}-anchored PDPK1 phosphorylates and activates AKT1, which regulates numerous downstream pathways such as inhibition of apoptosis (via BAX \citeref{gardai04} and BAD \citeref{datta97}) and cell cycle arrest (via CDKN1A \citeref{rossig01, li02} and CDKN1B \citeref{liang02}). (PDKP1 is the official symbol for 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1, and it is commonly known as PDK1, which also ambiguously refers to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1.) Conversely, PTEN (a phosphotase) inhibits the \gls{pi3k} pathway by dephosphorylating PIP\low{3} to PI(4,5)P\low{2}. Therefore, loss of \gene{PTEN} may potentiate \gls{pi3k} signaling and AKT1 activation, inducing cell survival and proliferation.

 \subsection{Crosstalk of signaling pathways}
 
-Although the presented pathways are described as distinct linear series of signaling events, the molecular players are in fact highly interconnected by several shared components (e.g. GSK3 and BTRC). Notably, many of the aforementioned signaling pathways converge on Myc family proteins, and this convergence underscores the central role played by the Myc family in medulloblastoma. Similarly, the upstream regulators of \gls{wnt} and \gls{shh} signaling, SMO and FZD, are both G-protein coupled receptors. Although their G-protein activities were underappreciated in the past, both receptors can regulate intracellular cAMP signaling, and these pathways may cooperate in promoting tumourigenesis. How various pathways are connected would likely depend on cell type or cell lineage, in addition to dynamic extracellular signals during development; hence, the cellular origins of medulloblastoma may dictate the molecular mechanisms of tumour initiation, progression, and maintenance.

 \section{Histological classification}
 
 The \gls{who} classification of \gls{cns} tumours standardizes the nomenclature for different cancers arising in the \gls{cns} and rests on the premise that each tumour type arises from the transformation of a specific cell type \citeref{kleihues93, who07}. The cellular origin, in turn, may predict prognosis and guide treatment decisions. The classification evolves with new discoveries and emerging insights, though it relies primarily on morphological features and protein marker expressions analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
 
-\gls{who} now recognizes medulloblastoma as a distinct entity \citeref{who07}. Medulloblastoma and \gls{cnspnet} used to be grouped collectively as \gls{pnet}, but \gls{who} now classifies them as distint diseases \citeref{who07}. The \gls{who} classification currently includes four histological variants of medulloblastoma: desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma, \gls{mben}, anaplastic medulloblastoma, and large cell medulloblastoma. The last two variants are often grouped together as \gls{lca}, though some evidence suggests that they may have different prognoses \citeref{vonhoff10}. Medullomyoblastoma and melanocytic medulloblastoma used to be considered histological variants of medulloblastoma in the 1993 classification \citeref{kleihues93}; however, in the latest \gls{who} classification (2007), they are no longer considered distinct histotype of medulloblastoma \citeref{who07}. About 70\% of medulloblastoma are of the classic histological variant \citeref{shih14}. Within this histotype, patient response to treatment varies greatly, indicating that the classic histotype encompasses a biologically heterogenous group of tumours \citeself{shih14}. The prognostic significance of the histotypes are discussed further in \citech{clin-prog}.

The subgroups have been independently identified in multiple studies \citeref{thompson06, kool08, northcott11a, remke11, cho11}, and this classification system can be applied objectively using a computer algorithm (see \citech{mb-class}) so that the process is streamlined and the results are reproducible. Although each of the molecular subgroups may be further subclassified into additional molecular subtypes, the division into four classes provide groups of tumours that are sufficiently homogeneous for predicting treatment outcome and revealing biological insights \citeref{taylor12, shih12, shih14}.
 
-Molecular classification by expression profiles have been described in numerous other cancer types, though the molecular classes are often not reproducibly discovered across studies and the classes often provide little scientific insight or clinical utility. For example, the classification of \gls{cnspnet} is not very robust \citeref{li09}, partly because \gls{cnspnet} is very rare and highly heterogeneous. Another problem occurs when a set of tumours are transcriptomically homogeneous. Although most clustering algorithms will nevertheless produce clusters from the expression profiles of these tumours, the resulting clusters may not represent biologically meaningful classes and will not be reproducible across cohorts \citeself{agnihotri14}. To emphasize, molecular classes discovered by unsupervised clustering should be reproduced across multiple cohorts.

-In other cancer types, many other molecular classification approaches have been used. For example, the molecular classes of breast cancer were initially discovered by expressiong profiling, but it is now predominantly classified by three protein markers --- estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and ERBB2 (HER2) --- as well as a marker for cellular proliferation (Ki67) into four main molecular subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, HER2 type, and basal-like \citeref{perou00, carey06, hu06, fan06, obrien10}. Prostate cancers can be molecularly classified into two classes: positive or negative for a gene fusion involving two ETS transcription factors, \gene{ERG} or \gene{ETV1}, which is found in approximately half of all prostate cancers \citeref{tomlins05}. In contrast, the classification of leukemia is far more complex and involves both histological features and cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. chromosomal rearrangements) \citeref{falini10}. Regardless of the metholody used, the ultimate objective of molecular classification is the same: separate cancers reproducibly into biologically similar classes so that they may share similar responses to treatments. Given this objective, one may consider classifying cancer types based on patient survival; however, this approach will likely not produce biologically similar classes, because patients can die for various reasons and patient survival can be heavily influenced by the treatments rendered.

 Current treatment protocols for medulloblastoma stratify patients based on clinical features: patient age, metastatic stage, and extent of resection. Patients are stratified into standard-risk and high-risk groups based on evidence of metastasis and size of the residual tumour after surgery. Additionally, infants are not irradiated to prevent impairment of neurological function by craniospinal irradiation. Typically, patients whose tumour was incompletely (subtotally) resected by surgery or has metastasized are classified as high-risk \citeref{polkinghorn07}.

-Our study will focus on three obstacles that hinders the development of targeted therapy against molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. First, current methods for classifying medulloblastoma into subgroups molecular classes are difficult to apply in the clinical setting. Second, current clinical prognostication of medulloblastoma poorly predicts patient survival and does not consider molecular subgroup. Third, few actionable therapeutic targets for WNT, Group3, and Group4 medulloblastomas have been discovered to date. In addressing these problems, we demonstrate the clinical significance of the molecular classification of medulloblastoma.

 \subsection*{Aim 1: Molecular classification of medulloblastoma for clinicians}
 
-Although the retrospective classification of medulloblastoma has been scientifically informative, molecular classification has not been applied in the context of a prospective clinical trial. One major obstacle is the lack of fresh-frozen samples for most clinical cases. Expression profiling, on which the molecular classification of medulloblastoma was based, depends on the availability of high-quality RNA. In contrast, clinical samples are routinely subjected to formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding, which preserves tissue integrity but causes nucleic acid degradation. To facilitate the development of therapy specifically targeted against molecular subgroups, we sought to establish an molecular classification assay that can be clinically applied on \gls{ffpe} samples. We have established an analytic pipeline for molecular classification using expression data generated by nanoString assays, and demonstrated its high classification accuracy on \gls{ffpe} samples \citeself{northcott12}. To further make the assay clinically applicable, we have implemented several quality-control measures that identify cases which cannot be reliably assigned molecular subgroups due to poor specimen quality or assay reaction failure.

 \subsection*{Aim 2: Clinical prognostication within molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma}
 
-Prior clinical prognostication studies in medulloblastoma have identified biomarkers without discriminating between the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. Given that medulloblastoma subgroups are biologically and molecular distinct disease entities, we hypothesized that incorporating molecular subgroup into prognostication can enhance the accuracy of survival prediction and improve the reliability of risk stratification. Practical and reliable identification of risk could allow for therapy intensification in high-risk children to improve survival and therapy de-escalation in low-risk children to avoid complications of therapy. By identifying clinical and molecular biomarkers within medulloblastoma subgroups, we have designed risk stratification schemes for SHH, Group3, and Group4 medulloblastoma that can achieve unprecedented levels of prognostic accuracy.

 \subsection*{Aim 3: Discovering therapeutic targets by genomic profiling of medulloblastoma}
 
 Following the adoption of the molecular classification of medulloblastoma, we then sought to identify molecular targets in medulloblastoma. Unlike SHH medulloblastomas, actionable therapeutic targets for WNT, Group3, and Group4 tumours have yet been identified. Since prior attempts have been underpowered to discriminate the genomic differences among the four molecular subgroups, the \gls{magic}, consisting of scientists and physicians from 43 cities across the globe, has gathered $>1200$ medulloblastomas. We analyzed the genomic copy-number profiles of the tumours by \gls{snp} arrays and identified genes and pathways that characterize each medulloblastoma subgroup \citeself{shih12}.

 \end{objective}
 
-Medulloblastoma can be classified by RNA expression profiles into four molecular subgroups: WNT, SHH, Group3, and Group4. These four subgroups show some modest association with the histological subtypes of medulloblastoma. The demosplastic histotype is enriched in SHH medulloblastoma (i.e. it is observed more often than expected by chance), while the large cell/anaplastic histotype is enriched in Group3 medulloblastoma. Nonetheless, the molecular classification is quite different from the histological classification. Despite its relative infancy, the molecular classification of medulloblastoma has gained widespread acceptance in the research community since the publication of the Taylor \emph{et al.}\ \citeref{taylor12}, a report of the consensus on classifying medulloblastoma by molecular profiles. Prior to this consensus report, several groups have independently discovered various molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma using different clustering analyses (hierarchical clustering and \gls{nmf} consensus clustering) for class discovery \citeref{thompson06, kool08, northcott11a, remke11}. On the surface, these studies discovered different molecular subtypes; moreover, each study discovered a different number of subtypes. Upon closer inspection, all the studies reported the delineation of a \gls{shh}-activated and a \gls{wnt}-activated subtype. Furthermore, most studies (those with sufficient sample size) discovered at least two additional molecular subgroups; the exact number of molecular subtypes discovered depended on the granularity of the clustering or partitioning analysis. Indeed, the number of molecular subtypes is not as biologically important as the existence of each molecular entity. (Refer to the \emphlab{Classification} section on page \pageref{sec:classification} in the \emphlab{Appendix} for a discussion on the difficulty in determining the number of classes.) In fact, most studies identified molecular subtypes bearing semblance to the GroupC and GroupD subtypes discovered by Northcott \emph{et al.}\ \citeref{northcott11a}, which have been renamed Group3 and Group4, respectively. To emphasize, each of the currently accepted WNT, SHH, and Group3, Group4 molecular subgroups have been identified in multiple studies, and these subgroups represent molecular entities that differ genetically, epidemiologically, and clinically \citeref{taylor12}.

 We sought to develop a method for classifying medulloblastoma samples into the four molecular subgroups. This method consists of two components: an experimental assay for measuring marker expression and a computational classifier for assigning molecular subgroup to an unknown medulloblastoma sample. We used the nanoString nCounter technology \citeref{geiss08} to directly measure the expression level of 22 subgroup-specific marker genes, each of which is overexpressed in one of the four molecular subgroups. We then selected the optimal classification algorithm from a panel of algorithms by comparing cross-validation accuracies. Subsequently, we validated the trained classifier on external datasets of medulloblastoma samples with independently assigned molecular subgroups.
 
-We did not use expression microarrays for measuring RNA expression because they have long been considered tools ill-suited for clinical diagnostics \citeref{shi08, deronde10, weigelt10, ein-dor06, frantz05, michiels05, ioannidis05, marshall04, check04, tan03, tilstone03}. While the aforementioned class-discovery studies used expression arrays (Affymetrix U133 or Exon ST 1.0) to measure the expression of all protein-coding genes (more than 20~000), we only needed for our purpose to measure the expression of genes that help discriminate between the molecular subgroups.  Reducing the number of genes to be measured simultaneously reduces the number of hybridizing probes, which in turn mitigates the potential for cross-hybridization (binding of probes to sequences other than the target sequence). Critically, expression microarrays typically require fresh-frozen samples and perform poorly on \gls{ffpe} samples. Even on microarray platforms specifically designed for \gls{ffpe} samples, the quality of the RNA from \gls{ffpe} samples are generally poor. Formalin fixation and paraffin embedding preserve cellular and tissue architecture but cause extensively degradation of nucleic acids, especially RNA. Further, microarrays are plagued by complex and diverse preprocessing procedures (probe signal normalization and subsequent processing), in addition to experiment-specific effects (unwanted variations). All these limitations abrogates the widespread adoption of microarrays in diagnostic laboratories. Conversely, the nanoString technology is less sensitive to RNA degradation and provides high reproducibility between experiments.

-The nanoString platform provide high-quality measurements of RNA expression and differs from expression microarrays in important ways \citeref{geiss08}. In nanoString, the probes are custom designed to a relatively small set of target gene transcripts, and the cross-hybridization limitation of microarrays is circumvented by reducing the number of hybridization targets. nanoString measures transcript abundance directly while expression microarrays require \emph{in vitro} transcription (or reverse transcription) and \gls{pcr} amplification. These enzymatic reactions can introduce bias (e.g. GC content bias) and variation (e.g. stochastic amplification by \gls{pcr}). Additionally, in an nanoString assay, transcripts are detected by the simultaneously binding of a pair of probes (a fluorescent-labeled reporter probe and a biotinylated capture probe) in solution (i.e. 3-dimensional space); for expression arrays in comparison, each target sequence binds to one immobilized probe on a 2-dimensional surface (chip or bead). (Mismatch probes present in older microarray designs such as Affymetrix U133 are often ignored during data normalization, and they have been eliminated in newer designs such as Affymetrix Exon ST 1.0.) These differences in hybridization allows nanoString to achieve higher specificity and sensitivity, especially for \gls{ffpe} tissue.

These differences in hybridization allow nanoString to achieve higher specificity and sensitivity, especially for \gls{ffpe} tissue \citeref{geiss08}.
 
-While clustering analysis has been instrumental in \emph{discovering} the molecular classes of medulloblastoma, it is ill-suited for predicting the class of a new, unknown sample. (See page \pageref{sec:classification} in the \textbf{Appendix} for the distinction between \emphterm{class discovery} and \emphterm{class prediction}.)  Clustering analysis can be sensitive to changes in sample size: removal or additional samples can drastically influence the clustering results. The inclusion of samples with poor quality measurements may also completely reorganize the clustering structure. Moreover, clustering analysis is particularly prone to batch effects, where the discovered classes represent different technical batches of samples and do not reflect underlying biology. In comparison, class prediction can mitigate these effects by selecting for features that discriminate between the different classes and by assessing training and testing accuracies separately. Admittedly, clustering algorithms can be adapted for class prediction, but existing classification algorithms are more widely applied, more extensively tested, and better understood. Furthermore, model-based classifiers can be designed under the classification framework in order to exploit specific statistical properties of the input data and thus improve prediction accuracy. Above all, we prefer to use or refine an ready suitable tool rather than to re-purpose a tool designed for another task.

 We show that our method can accurately predict the molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma samples. The method is reproducible across different nanoString service centres and across different datasets. The assays only cost about \$50 a sample at a throughput up to 100 samples a week. Thus, we have developed a molecular classification method for medulloblastoma that is rapid, reliable, and reproducible, and this method can be readily adopted for use in a diagnostic laboratory.

 \subsection{nanoString data processing and class prediction}
 
 Raw nanoString counts for each gene within each experiment were centered using geometric means of the counts obtained for positive control probe sets prior to a biological normalization using the three housekeeping genes included in the CodeSet.  Normalized data were log2-transformed and used as input for class prediction analysis (zero counts were mapped to zero).
 
-A series of medulloblastomas with known subgroup affiliation ($n = 101$) were used to establish a training dataset for subsequent class prediction analysis of independent cohorts used in the study.  Various class prediction algorithms were assessed by a 10-fold cross-validation scheme, using a set of scoring indices to establish a pipeline for prediction of medulloblastoma subgroups using nanoString data derived from the training series.  Based on superior performance in cross-validation analysis, the PAM method was selected for all downstream class prediction analyses.

-All class prediction analyses were performed in the R statistical programming environment (v2.13). Implementations of the class prediction algorithms were imported from the following R packages: MASS v7.3 (linear discriminant analysis; LDA), class v7.3 (k-nearest neighbor; KNN), e1071 v1.5 (support vector machine; SVM), nnet v7.3 (multinomial log-linear model; MULT), and pamr v1.51 (prediction analysis for microarrays; PAM) \citeref{tibshirani02}. During cross-validation, the training set of 101 samples was randomly split into 10 partitions. Each class predictor was trained on nine of the partitions, and the performance of the predictor was subsequently tested on the one remaining partition. Each of the 10 partitions was used as the testing set in turn for a round of cross-validation, for a total of 10,000 rounds of cross-validation, which was

-The scoring indices used during testing were simple accuracy, Jaccard similarity index, Rand index, adjusted Rand index, and Fowlkes–Mallows index. The latter four indices are different indices for determining the similarity between two groupings, which are the known and predicted classifications of samples in the current analysis. These indices serve as more stringent measures of accuracy in multiclass prediction. Aside from the aforementioned measures of accuracy, the reliabilities of the predictors were also determined using Shannon entropy as a measure of uncertainty. Predictors with varying predicted classes for the same sample across the cross-validation rounds have higher entropy values, and are hence less reliable.

 Since the model parameters for SVM can affect the prediction performance, these parameters were optimized by a grid search in a separate round of cross-validation. The ranges of searched parameter values were: $[2^{-5}, 2^{15}]$ for \code{C}; $[2^{-15}, 2^3]$ for \code{gamma}; $[2, 8]$ for \code{degree}; $[-1, 1]$ for \code{coef0}. Further, SVM using different kernels (linear, radial basis, polynomial, and sigmoid) were assessed, and the kernel with the best performance was selected. Similarly for KNN, the best model was selected from models with different $k$.

-In order to select a classification algorithm that predicts most accurately and reliably, we evaluated the class prediction performance of a panel of well-known classifiers: \gls{svm}, \gls{lda}, multinomial logistic regression, \gls{knn}, \gls{pam}. (Note that \gls{pam} is to be distinguished from the clustering algorithm, partitioning around medoids; \gls{lda} is also to be distinguished from latent Dirichlet allocation, another unsupervised learning algorithm.)  These classifiers were trained on a training set of 101 fresh-frozen medulloblastoma samples with known molecular subgroups. Classifiers that have tuning parameters (\gls{svm}, \gls{pam}, and \gls{knn}) were tuned using a round of 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of all classifiers were assessed using repeated, stratified, 10-fold cross-validation using various measures of accuracy. \gls{pam} consistently showed superior performance to all other classifiers. Its predictions are most consistent across multiple rounds of cross-validation, indicating that its predictions are reliable. In comparison, multinomial logistic regression predicted different subgroups for the same sample when it was trained on different subsets of the training data, illustrating that it does not generalize well and its predictions are unreliable. Further, the test accuracy of the \gls{pam} algorithm as assessed by cross-validation was the highest. Admittedly, the test accuracies of all classification algorithms were high and roughly in the same range, though \gls{pam} consistently outperform all the other classifiers in repeated rounds of cross-validation.

 Therefore, we proceeded to evaluate the performance of the trained \gls{pam} classifier on external datasets of medulloblastoma samples with independently assigned molecular subgroups. The original molecular subtypes from the previous studies were mapped to the consensus molecular subgroups using the mapping detailed in the consensus report \citeref{taylor12}. The performance of the trained classifier was tested on an external set of 130 fresh-frozen medulloblastoma samples. By testing on an external validation set that is disjoint from the training set, we show that our classifier generalizes well and is insensitive to irrelevant variability across datasets. Indeed, our method achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98\% (\citefig{nanostr-valid}).

 Since the initial publication of this work \citeself{northcott12}, we have used the method to classify over 1000 medulloblastoma samples, of which 538 samples now have known subgroup affiliations determined from unsupervised clustering analysis on expression profiles. Using the classifier trained on the original training set ($n = 103$) to predict the subgroup of fresh-frozen samples in a non-overlapping new validation set ($n = 453$) yielded a classification accuracy of 92\%, which is lower than the accuracy previously achieved (98 \%) on the original external validation set of fresh-frozen samples ($n = 131$; \citefig{nanostr-valid}). Additionally, a few samples with replicate nanoString assays produced different class predictions. Further examination revealed that poor sample quality and suboptimal assay conditions likely contributed to errors in class prediction.
 
-Therefore, additional quality control measures were implemented to identify unreliable results due to poor RNA quality and nanoString assay failure. Given that standard measurements of RNA quality were insufficient for predicting assay accuracy \citeself{northcott12}, the mean signals of the endogenous-control probes included in the nanoString assay were used to assess whether sufficient quantities of intact RNA were present in the samples, using an outlier detection method. Samples with low endogenous-control signal, presumably due to extensive RNA degradation, cannot be reliably assigned a molecular subgroup, and they may require repeat RNA extraction or alternative classification method using DNA copy-number or methylation profiling. Similarly, nanoString assays may fail due to suboptimal reaction conditions (caused by pipetting error or sample contaminants). The mean signals of positive-control probes were therefore used to identify assay failures using outlier detection. The endogenous-control and positive-control quality measures helped improved accuracy on the new validation set to 94\%. Although the improvement in prediction accuracy on fresh-frozen samples is very modest, we expect a much greater improvement for \gls{ffpe} samples, which typically have much poorer RNA quality \citeref{northcott12}.

 \section{Discussion}
 
-We have developed and validated a reliable method for classifying medulloblastoma into molecular subgroups. Importantly, our classification method complements rather than substitutes histological diagnosis. The diagnosis of medulloblastoma from a cerebellar or posterior fossa tumour requires histological examination and exclusion of genetically defined brain tumour entities including \gls{atrt}, which is characterized by \gene{SMARCB1} mutation, and \gls{etmr}, which is characterized by amplification of the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster. Given a medulloblastoma sample, our method produces probabilities of the sample belonging to each subgroup. A sample with a low prediction probability for the most probable subgroup would warrant a second examination of its histological diagnosis. Given an unknown brain tumour sample, we would also need to entertain the possibility that a non-medulloblastoma sample may exclusively express markers that define one of the medulloblastoma subgroups. Notwithstanding this limitation, we show that our method produces reproducible results across different centres and on multiple validation datasets. Furthermore, the method performs well on \gls{ffpe} material, allowing it to be readily adopted in diagnostic laboratories. Since the publication of our classification method in Northcott \emph{et al.}\ \citeself{northcott12}, and we have made additional improvements to the method. Currently, we are refining the classification method for \gls{clia} certification.

-In order reliably guide clinical decision making, we are designing classifiers that emit calibrated prediction probabilities. Presently, trained classifier can output class probabilities that deviate from true probabilities. For example, samples that are predicted to be SHH medulloblastoma at a class probability of 99\% contains less than 99\% true SHH medulloblastoma samples; that is, more than 1\% of the predicted SHH samples at class probability $\ge$ 99\% are in fact not SHH medulloblastoma. Calibrated probabilities are desirable because they can be incorporated into the decision theory framework to achieve the optimal balance between risks and benefits of future treatments targeted against each specific molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma.

 As later chapters will show, the classification of medulloblastoma into WNT, SHH, Group3, and Group4 is practically useful and catalyzes research in elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying medulloblastoma.

-Medulloblastoma was a uniformly fatal disease with a survival duration of mere months until the introduction of systematic irradiation of the entire central nervous system in the 1940s \citeref{paterson53}. Prior to the adoption of craniospinal (whole brain and spine) irradiation, medulloblastoma cases treated surgical resection and localized radiotherapy recur with metastases in the subarachnoid space \citeref{mcfarland69}. Although the propensity of medulloblastoma to metastasize necessitated whole \gls{cns} radiotherapy, exposing the developing brain to irradiation led to long-term neuropsychological sequelae that were beginning to be documented in the 1960s \citeref{mcfarland69, gudrunardottir14}. The integration of chemotherapy in the 1970s into the standard treatment of medulloblastoma led to a concomitant rise in patient survival \citeref{gudrunardottir14}. Chemotherapeutic drugs, however, can also have immediate and long-term adverse effects on neurocognitive function \citeref{khong06, zeller13, avan15}. Today, patients with medulloblastoma are treated by surgical resection, followed by craniospinal irradiation and combination chemotherapy. While advances in imaging and surgical technologies have largely eliminated operative mortality and minimized damage to the brain during resection, craniospinal irradiation and combination chemotherapy continue to impair neural development and cause debilitating neurocognitive decline of long-term survivors \citeref{palmer13, schreiber14, knight14, gudrunardottir14}. With modern treatment, patients with medulloblastoma can be cured, but at great cost to their qualities of life.

 Aside from impairing brain development, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cause various other side-effects in long-term survivors of childhood cancer. They can cause endocrinological complications, resulting in delayed puberty, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and stunted growth; and neurological complications, leading to symptoms including limb weakness, prolonged pain, reduced sense of touch, balance problems, permanent hearing loss, blindness, seizures, tremors, and paralysis \citeref{armstrong09, xu03, edelstein11, christopherson14, avan15, boman09, duffner98}. Ironically, these anti-cancer treatments can also predispose patients to second cancers \citeref{armstrong09, packer13, christopherson14, avan15, boman09, duffner98}.
 
-The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study reported sobering statistics for adult survivors of childhood cancers and highlighted adverse, long-term socioeconomic consequences of chemotherapeutic and irradiation treatment \citeref{hudson03, mitby03}. The survivors, compared to unaffected siblings, are 5 times more likely to suffer from functional impairments that prohibits independent living, 2 times more likely to earn less than \$20~000 in annual household income \citeref{hudson03}. (Most participants of this study were based in the United States, in which the median household income is more than \$50~000 during the same period \citeref{denavas14}.) Specifically for childhood \gls{cns} cancers, the survivors are 18 times more likely to suffer from functional impairments \citeref{hudson03}. Moreover, 70\% of survivors diagnosed with \gls{cns} cancer before age 6 years require special education services to cope with learning or emotional difficulties \citeref{mitby03}. The survivors' use of special education is directly related to the treatment received: cranial irradiation treatment alone increases the odds of needing special education by 7 times, while methotrexate treatment alone increases this odds by 1.3 times, compared to unaffected siblings \citeref{mitby03}. While the long-term neurocognitive effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and brain tumour itself are intertwined, these findings suggest that cranial irradiation may be the most damaging treatment, and chemotherapy, albeit less harmful, is not entirely innocuous many years after treatment either.

 Radiotherapy causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) of dividing cancer cells, but it can also cause normal dividing cells to die, leading to physical, endocrinologic, and neurologic sequelae. In a developing brain, dividing neural progenitors are sensitive to irradiation. Additionally, quiescent neural progenitors or stem cells can also incur radiation-induced DNA damage whose effect may manifest later in life. In patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cranial radiation causes decline in intelligence, and this decline is progressive, showing more impairment of cognitive function with increasing time since radiation therapy \citeref{krull13}. Nowadays, cranial irradiation is reserved for the fewer than 20\% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are considered to be at high risk for \gls{cns} relapse, in order to spare the maturing brain of the neurotoxic side-effect of radiotherapy \citeref{pui08}. Conversely, brain tumours usually require irradiation for complete tumour eradication and long-term patient survival, though clinicians are increasingly aware of neurologic sequelae following radiotherapy. A recently completed prospective trial assessing 54 Gy conformal (targeted against the tumour bed) radiotherapy in low-grade glioma patients revealed a striking correlation between age at treatment and subsequent decline in \gls{iq} score: the younger the survivor was during conformal radiotherapy, the more severe was the decline in intelligence \citeref{merchant09}. Similarly, younger children with medulloblastoma treated with high-dose irradiation had worse progressive decline in intellectual outcome and academic performance compared to children of older age at diagnosis \citeref{radcliffe94, palmer13, schreiber14, knight14, mulhern98}. Even with a reduced dose of craniospinal radiotherapy, survivors continue to show progressive decline in intellectual and academic outcomes \citeref{ris13, mulhern05, ris01, mulhern98}.
 
-Several attempts have been made over the past three decades to minimize exposure of the developing brain to irradiation. One of the first prospective trial in reducing radiotherapy for patients with medulloblastoma reported an increased rate of tumour recurrence and consequently closed early \citeref{deutsch96}, highlighting the need for a planned strategy for salvaging non-responding disease in order to maintain patient survival. While earlier attempts at reducing craniospinal irradiation led to poorer survival \citeref{thomas00, deutsch96, bailey95, bouffet92}, other attempts at reducing craniospinal irradiation did not compromise patient survival by incorporating chemotherapy into the treatment regiment \citeref{packer06, packer94, packer99, kim10, halberg91, oyharcabal-bourden05, sung13}. Extending this approach, numerous oncology groups sought to postpone or eliminate radiotherapy in young children by using chemotherapy to control or eradicate the tumour \citeref{mulhern89, rutkowski05, jeng93, duffner93, geyer94, gentet95, duffner99, walter99, oyharcabal-bourden05, grill05, geyer05, dhall08, sands10, grundy10, vonbueren11, saha14, yasuda08, kellie02, white98, strauss91}. Unfortunately, postsurgical chemotherapy alone often cannot achieve complete response of the residual tumour, leading to eventual use of radiotherapy. For example, combination chemotherapy with vinblastine, cisplatin, and etoposide was insufficient by itself to induce complete remission of residual medulloblastoma, and patients often progress during chemotherapy. \citeref{jeng93, gajjar94, walter99}. Patients with chemoresistance tumours could be salvaged with subsequent radiotherapy; however, survivors treated with delayed radiotherapy can still suffer from neurodevelopmental deficits \citeref{gajjar94, grill05}.

-In yet other trials, clinicians have successfully used high-dose combination therapy to eliminate irradiation treatment in young children with non-metastatic medulloblastoma. Geyer \emph{et al.}\ showed that two combination therapy regimens (vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide; or vincristine, carboplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide) could both obviated the need for radiotherapy in patients with no metastatic or residual tumour after surgery \citeref{geyer05}.  Similarly, Grill \emph{et al.}\ used combination chemotherapy (carboplatin, procarbazine, etoposide, cisplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide) and salvaged progressive medulloblastoma with radiation and additional high-dose chemotherapy (busulfan, thiotepa, and melphalan) \citeref{grill05}. Patients without metastasis or residual tumour exhibited favourable outcome, and the survivors in this study also had improved intellectual outcome compared to radiotherapy-treated patients \citeref{grill05}. Rutkowski \emph{et al.}\ used combination chemotherapy alone (including vincristine, carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate) and achieved great survival outcome for children without metastasis or residual tumour \citeref{rutkowski05}. Decline in \gls{iq} was still evident among the non-irradiated survivors, albeit less severe than those who had received radiotherapy \citeref{rutkowski05}. Chi \emph{et al.}\ using combination chemotherapy (vincristine, cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and thiotepa) and autologous stem cell transplant following the consolidation chemotherapy, yielded complete response in macroscopically metastatic medulloblastomas without the need for radiotherapy \citeref{chi04}. The efforts in using chemotherapy to ward off radiotherapy resulted in the adoption of withholding or postponing radiotherapy for treating young children with medulloblastoma in most of North America and Europe.

Geyer \emph{et al.}\ showed that two combination therapy regimens (vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide; or vincristine, carboplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide) could both obviate the need for radiotherapy in patients with no metastatic or residual tumour after surgery \citeref{geyer05}.  Similarly, Grill \emph{et al.}\ used combination chemotherapy (carboplatin, procarbazine, etoposide, cisplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide) and salvaged progressive medulloblastoma with radiation and additional high-dose chemotherapy (busulfan, thiotepa, and melphalan) \citeref{grill05}. Patients without metastasis or residual tumour exhibited favourable outcome, and the survivors in this study also had improved intellectual outcome compared to radiotherapy-treated patients \citeref{grill05}. Rutkowski \emph{et al.}\ used combination chemotherapy alone (including vincristine, carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate) and achieved favourable survival outcomes for children without metastasis or residual tumour \citeref{rutkowski05}. Decline in \gls{iq} was still evident among the non-irradiated survivors, albeit less severe than those who had received radiotherapy \citeref{rutkowski05}. Chi \emph{et al.}\ using combination chemotherapy (vincristine, cisplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and thiotepa) and autologous stem cell transplant following the consolidation chemotherapy, yielded complete response in macroscopically metastatic medulloblastomas without the need for radiotherapy \citeref{chi04}. Hence, efforts in using chemotherapy to ward off radiotherapy led to the adoption of the practice of withholding or postponing radiotherapy for treating young children with medulloblastoma in most of North America and Europe.
 
 Based on the results of more recent trials, however, clinicians remain divided on the use of radiotherapy in young children. The HIT~2000 trial (2001--2005) confirmed that combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, carboplatin, etoposide, and methotrexate) can maintain favourable survivorship without radiotherapy in nonmetastatic medulloblastoma \citeref{vonbueren11}. Unless complete remission was achieved following induction, the authors recommended contingent treatment with local radiotherapy, secondary surgery, and consolidation chemotherapy (cisplatin, lomustine, and vincristine) \citeref{vonbueren11}. Conversely, the COG-P9934 trial (2000--2006) brought back unconditional, planned irradiation and showed that conformal radiotherapy (localized to posterior fossa and tumour bed) in addition to chemotherapy achieved superior progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone by comparing against the POG-9233 trial \citeref{ashley12}. Despite known risk for long-term neurotoxicity in children, the authors contended that radiotherapy is still required for optimal survival of patients with nonmetastatic medulloblastoma \citeref{ashley12}.
 
-Given the limited capability for chemotherapy to replace radiotherapy in all patients, it is important to select the patients who are at low risk of progressive or recurrent medulloblastoma and evaluate their candidacy for therapy de-escalation. Currently, the main risk factors for medulloblastoma relapse are residual tumour after subtotal surgical resection and presentation with metastasis either macroscopically or in the cerebral spinal fluid. As earlier trials have shown, patients with residual disease or metastasis are poor candidates for reduced or withheld radiotherapy \citeref{grill05, rutkowski05}, though one trial have some success with metastatic medulloblastoma \citeref{chi04}. Additionally, the 5-year overall survival rate for nonmetastatic, completely resected medulloblastoma in young children (age $< 3$) of the HITSKK92 trial (1992--1997) was an impressive 93\% ($n = 17$), while the POG-9233 trial (1992--ongoing) reported a 5-year overall survival rate of 43\% ($n = 37$) for nonmetastatic, completely resected medulloblastoma. Indeed, the results from the two trials are difficult to compare, given differences in the chemotherapy regimen, surgical resection, imaging technologies, and supportive care. Nonetheless, the striking difference in survival for what should be similar cases of medulloblastoma suggest that the two cohorts are, in fact, biologically dissimilar. Accordingly, the prognostic factors currently used in patient risk stratification, metastasis at diagnosis and extent of resection, fail to accurately identify favourable responders to chemotherapeutic treatment.

 What has been missing in past clinical trials is the classification of medulloblastoma into molecular subgroups. As medulloblastoma subgroups exhibit different survivorships (\citefig{surv_mb-subgroups}), we believe that subgroups may be useful for risk stratification of patients. Further, given the distinct origins of subgroups \citeref{gibson10}, we hypothesize that prognostic markers would be influenced by subgroups. That is, some markers may be prognostic only in specific subgroups while others may be surrogate markers of subgroup status and have no prognostic value themselves. Therefore, by incorporating molecular subgroups into risk stratification, we believe that we would be able to more accurately predict favourable responders to treatment and obviate the need for indiscriminate administration of intensive treatment to children, who will suffer long-term treatment-induced toxicities. By improving risk stratification and tuning treatment intensity, we hope to minimize collateral damage to the patient's developing brain and preserve the survivor's quality of life.

-The current paucity of markers used in risk stratification is not due to a lack of biomarker studies. Indeed, the medulloblastoma literature is rife with reports of prognostic markers. Most of the purported markers, however, do not reproducibly predict survival in different cohorts due to small sample sizes and distributional differences in underlying covariates \citeself{shih14}. We purport that disagreements in prior biomarker identification attempts may be explained by differences in the composition of medulloblastoma subgroups in the different cohorts. For example, patients with desmoplastic medulloblastoma often exhibit better survival \citeref{chatty71, rutkowski05, kool12, pietsch14, dhall08, vonbueren11, ashley12, grundy10}, and the discordant survival outcomes between the POG-9233 and the COG-P9934 trials could be due the latter having a higher proportion of desmoplastic medulloblastoma \citeref{ashley12}. The aforementioned difference in survival outcomes between the POG-9233 and the HITSKK92 trial could also be due to a similar reason. Indeed, the small sample sizes in these trials (POG-9233, $n = 112$; HITSKK92, $n = 62 $; COG-P9934, $n = 82$) makes uneven distribution of covariates likely, and these covariates may be responsible for the outcome differences. Further, while desmoplastic histology has been proposed to be one such covariate, it is likely that unobserved covariates such as molecular subgroups and genetic mutations may better explain the differences in response. In addition to its status as a favourable prognostic factor, desmoplasia has also been reported to be a prognostic factor for poor survival in medulloblastoma by some \citeref{park83, gajjar06, rutkowski10} and an insignificant factor by others \citeref{pietsch14, lannering12}. High interobserver and intraobserver variability in histological examination may be responsible for these discrepancies. Therefore, difficulty and variability in assessment can limit the utility of a biomarker, and competing covariates should be assessed carefully.

Therefore, difficulty and variability in assessment can limit the utility of a biomarker, and competing covariates should be assessed carefully.
 
 In order to mitigate the problems of small sample size and competing unobserved covariates, we assembled an large, international cohort of 673 medulloblastoma samples with clinical annotation. The cytogenetic and focal copy-number events were determined using copy-number profiling on this discovery cohort. We identified subgroup-specific cytogenetic events and integrated them with clinical variables to develop subgroup-specific, multivariate risk-stratification models based on the discovery cohort. In order to validate the models and ensure that the technique was generalizable to routine pathology laboratories, we then studied a panel of six cytogenetic biomarkers (\gene{GLI2}, \gene{MYC}, 11, 14, 17p, and 17q) using interphase \gls{fish} on an \gls{ffpe} medulloblastoma tissue microarray that includes a set of 453 medulloblastomas that were treated at a single center and does not overlap with the discovery cohort.
 
-The size of our discovery and validation cohorts provides unprecedented power for clinical prognostication and enables comprehensive, multivariate modeling of patient survival to identify robust prognostic markers \citefig{meta_cyto-markers}. In this retrospective study, we wish to comprehensively assess cytogenetic markers in the context of the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma and determine whether subgroup affiliation could complement clinical variables for more accurate risk stratification of patients and predict favourable responders for de-escalation of radiotherapy in order to improve the quality of life for survivors. Being retrospective, our cohort is subject to recall bias (for cases with frozen samples), and it encompasses heterogeneously treated patients from multiple centres and continents. Our histology records were not centrally reviewed; nevertheless, our study reflects the typical clinical experience more closely and implicitly reveals the weakness of histological diagnosis in decentralized clinical practice. Further, the lack of surgical details and treatment protocols precludes analyses on how specific treatments and extent of surgical resection affect survival outcome. Notwithstanding the limitations of our discovery cohort, the findings are highly reproducible in an independent cohort of patients.

 \subsection{Subgroup specificity of published molecular biomarkers}
 
-Several cytogenetic biomarkers have been previously reported to be associated with patient survival across medulloblastoma, but their prognostic values have seldom been assessed in the context of medulloblastoma subgroups \citeself{shih14}. Loss of chromosome 6 is significantly associated with improved survival across all medulloblastoma (\citefig{subgroup-specific_eg}\emphlab{a}). However, the prognostic value of chr6 loss can be completely attributed to its enrichment in WNT medulloblastomas, as chr6 loss has no prognostic value among WNT patients, or among non-WNT patients, when compared to their respective controls with balanced chr6 (\citefig{subgroup-specific_eg}\emphlab{b}). We would suggest that chr6 loss is a subgroup-driven biomarker in that its prognostic significance is driven by its enrichment in a particular subgroup, and it thus has no further significance in subgroup-specific analysis. Further, based on these results, we would caution against using chr6 loss as the lone diagnostic criteria for WNT medulloblastoma, since it is also observed in non-WNT medulloblastoma (7/49 chr6 loss medulloblastomas were not WNT (14\%)), and chr6 loss is only present in 42/53 WNT tumours (79\%). The prognostic role of isochromosome 17q (iso17q) has been very controversial; in our cohort, iso17q is a statistically significant predictor of poor outcome overall (\citefig{subgroup-specific_eg}\emphlab{c}).  However, subgroup-specific analysis demonstrates that iso17q is highly prognostic for Group3 medulloblastoma, but not for Group4 medulloblastoma (\citefig{subgroup-specific_eg}\emphlab{d}), indicating that it is a subgroup-specific molecular biomarker.  Similarly, while chr10q loss is a modestly significant predictor of poor outcome across medulloblastoma subgroups (\citefig{subgroup-specific_eg}\emphlab{e}), its prognostic power is limited to the SHH subgroup of tumours in a subgroup-specific analysis (\citefig{subgroup-specific_eg}\emphlab{f}).  We conclude that determination of molecular subgroup is crucial in the evaluation and implementation of molecular biomarkers for patients with medulloblastoma, as some putative biomarkers are merely enriching for a specific subgroup (\emphterm{subgroup driven}) while most others are only significant within a specific subgroup (\emphterm{subgroup specific}).

 \section{Discussion}
 
-The analysis of $> 1000$ medulloblastoma patients clearly demonstrates that subgroup affiliation enhances prognostication with clinical biomarkers and that the majority of published molecular biomarkers are only relevant in the setting of a single subgroup. The combination of clinical variables, molecular subgroup, and six cytogenetic markers analyzed on \gls{ffpe} tissues can achieve an unprecedented level of prognostic prediction for medulloblastoma patients that is practical, reliable, and reproducible. The proposed risk stratification models represent those that best fit the available data in the discovery cohort. The performances of our models are robust against the choice of prognostic markers. Despite the large size of our discovery cohort, missing data and the complexity of multivariate analyses may necessitate the use of even larger cohorts to assess the inclusion of additional prognostic markers. Moreover, while we strive to include the most important markers in multivariate models, we cannot exclude the possibility of that alternative markers may perform equally well. Our results nonetheless elucidate the prognostic potential of known and novel markers and highlight clinically useful risk-stratification schemes.

 The prognostic significance of M1 status (presence of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid) has long been controversial. Most reports agree that presence of metastasis portends poor prognosis and warrants intensified treatment \citeref{grill05, rutkowski05, salama06, rutkowski10, kool12, pietsch14, vonhoff09, bouffet94, zeltzer99}; however, it is unclear whether M1 disease has the same prognosis as M2/M3 (macroscopic metastasis). Kortmann \emph{et al.}\ contended in a prospective trial that M2/M3 status were indicators of poor outcome in medulloblastoma, but residual disease or M1 status were not \citeref{kortmann00}. In another prospective trial, Zeltzer \emph{et al.}\ maintained that both M1 and M2/M3 statuses were prognostically unfavourable \citeref{zeltzer99}. In subsequent studies, some investigators group M0 and M1 together in one category \citeref{rutkowski05, pietsch14}, while others group M1, M2 and M3 together as M+ \citeref{rutkowski10, kool12, pietsch14, strother14}. In a retrospective review, Sanders \emph{et al.}\ reported that M1 patients do not have better survival than M2/M3 patients under the same treatment \citeref{sanders08}. In our cohorts, the prognostic significance of M1 disease may be subgroup specific, though the small sample size of M1 patients hinders a definitive conclusion \citeself{shih14}. Based on our data, it is unlikely that M1 status is a universal indicator of poor outcome. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether M1 was categorized with M0 or M2/M3, our risk-stratification models can reproducibly and robustly predict patient survival.
 
 Controversy also surrounds the prognostic value of anaplastic histology. Large cell and anaplastic histologies are often grouped together because these histological features often co-occur and can be difficult to distinguish. Several studies reveal that large cell/anaplastic histology is prognostically unfavourable \citeref{gajjar04, jakacki12, kool12, pietsch14}. von Hoff \emph{et al.}\ distinguished between large cell and anaplastic histologies and reported that large cell histology was a negative prognostic factor while anaplasia was not \citeref{vonhoff10}. The authors further suggested that \emph{MYC} amplification, which co-occurred with large cell histology, may be the underlying cause of poor prognosis; however, the precise definition of \emph{MYC} amplification remains contentious \citeref{vonhoff10, raabe10}. We clarify this issue by demonstrating that only high-level \emph{MYC} amplification but not single copy gains of \emph{MYC} (focal or broad) is prognostically significant. Additionally, large cell/anaplastic histology has no prognostic value in a multivariate model accounting for \emph{MYC} amplification. Possibly, \emph{MYC} amplification may be a marker for apoptotic resistance, leading to resistance against radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Although MYC promotes cell proliferation, it also normally induces apoptosis; therefore, \emph{MYC} amplification is incompatible with tumour formation except in the context of apoptotic pathway disruption \citeref{pei12}.
 
-Another marker notably absent from our risk-stratification schemes is \gene{TP53} mutation, which is a well-known indicator of poor prognosis \citeref{zhukova13}. Loss of TP53 function abrogates the apoptotic pathway and contributes to resistance against chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While we had some \gene{TP53} mutation data in our cohorts, a substantial proportion of samples were not interrogated for \gene{TP53} status. Additionally, \gene{TP53} mutation appears to be predominately prognostic for long-term survivors \citeref{zhukova13}, and the follow-up lengths in our cohorts were insufficient to evaluate the prognostic impact of \gene{TP53} mutation. Therefore, the utility of \gene{TP53} mutation in multivariate patient risk-stratification should be further assessed in a cohort with more complete data and longer follow-up.

 The absence of age in our risk stratification schemes bodes well for the modern practice of restricting the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of young children. Indeed, age groups are not associated with the risk groups defined by our models, and the survival differences among the risk groups cannot be explained by differences in age distributions. Furthermore, age (discretized or otherwise) has no prognostic value in multivariate survival models once such prognostic factors such as metastatic status is included \citeself{shih14}. The univariate significance of age for poor outcome may be explained by the notation that early age at diagnosis is simply a proxy for tumour aggressiveness. While some aggressive tumours arise early, not all early arising tumours are aggressive. Accordingly, age has little independent prognostic value in a multivariate survival model, despite that infants often receive less intensive treatment in contemporary protocols. Our results suggest that elimination of radiotherapy and dose reduction in chemotherapy has not contributed to poorer survival of infants; rather, aggressive tumours that respond poorly to treatment sometimes present in infants.
 
-Above all, our risk stratification models identify patient groups who are promising candidates for de-escalation or elimination of irradiation during treatment. In particular, WNT patients exhibit excellent long term survival; with careful monitoring, these patients may respond well to reduced radiotherapy with postsurgical chemotherapy. For SHH medulloblastoma, the finding that infants in the low-risk group under our model respond favourably to multimodal treatment (with presumably reduced or eliminated radiotherapy) points to the tantalizing possibility that the remaining patients in this low risk group (defined by absence of all unfavourable markers) may similarly respond well to chemotherapy alone. Given that SHH medulloblastoma tend not to recur with metastasis \citeref{ramaswamy13}, localized radiotherapy may be sufficient to prevent recurrence. Among patients with Group4 medulloblastoma, some patients with metastatic disease show excellent survival. Since patients presenting with metastasis are traditionally considered high risk, their apparent favourable outcome in our cohorts begs the question: Did they need the intensified radiotherapy for tumour eradication? If their favourable survival is not attributable to intensified treatment, these patients may benefit from radiotherapy de-escalation and survive with improved qualities of life. Encouragingly, recent findings suggest that the dose of craniospinal irradiation might be reduced in high-risk medulloblastoma (metastatic or residual disease) without compromising survival by supplementing the treatment with tandem high dose chemotherapy (and autologous stem cell transplantation) \citeref{sung13}.

-To conclude, we demonstrate that medulloblastoma molecular subgroup is highly informative for predicting patient outcome, and we can dramatically improve the accuracy of survival prediction by incorporating molecular subgroup with conventional clinical parameters for patient risk stratification. Moreover, we proposed, tested, and validated novel subgroup-specific risk stratification models that consider both clinical and molecular variables.  These models perform robustly and reproducibly both in the discovery cohort consisting of a heterogeneously treated group of patients and in a large non-overlapping validation cohort of patients treated at a single institution according to a single treatment protocol. Given that we do not have detailed treatment information for patients in these cohorts, it is highly possible that treatment effects (type, duration, or intensity) could impact our results. We would suggest that this can only be accounted through examination of our stratification model in a sufficiently large prospectively followed cohort of patients with medulloblastoma. While the current study uses either \gls{snp} arrays, or interphase \gls{fish} on \gls{ffpe} sections, it is possible that other approaches such as \gls{acgh} could also be used to determine the copy-number status of the six cytogenetic markers. Our results demonstrate the utility of incorporating tumour biology into clinical decision-making and offer a novel perspective on risk stratification using \gls{fish} (applicable on paraffin sections), and thus should be validated in prospective multi-centre trials and be translated into routine clinical practice.

-Increased awareness of long-term neurotoxcity of craniospinal irradiation has motivated the de-escalation of radiotherapy by incorporating dose-intensive combination chemotherpay into the treatment regime. In order to eradicate tumour cells, chemotherapy is often intensified to the point where autologous stem cell transplants are required to circumvent patient mortality. Albeit less harmful, chemotherapy is not without neurocognitive and functional consequences for survivors. In one trial, addition of chemotherapy to craniospinal irradiation caused long-term survivors of medulloblastoma to suffer poorer health status \citeref{bull07}. In another trial, patients with medulloblastoma who were treated with chemotherapy alone (vincristine, carboplatin, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate) suffered from declines in neurocognitive function \citeref{rutkowski05}. Perhaps part of the decline could be due to the disease itself; however, even for patients with acute lymphoplastic leukemia, chemotherapy alone (vincristine, methotrexate, prednisone, and antracyclines) can cause reduction in volumes of several neuroanatomic structures of the brain and consequent decline in processing speed, executive function, learning and memory \citeref{zeller13}. Furthermore, chemotherapy causes a myarid of other side-effects; for example, it increases the risk of infection for patients due to suppression of immune system. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin can cause permanent hearing loss and peripheral neurotoxicity \citeref{avan15}.

-To faciliate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, we sought to identify recurrently dysregulated genes and pathways by analyzing the DNA copy-number profiles of $> 1000$ primary medulloblastoma samples (before radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Genes amplified recurrently across tumours are candidate proto-oncogenes, against which therapeutic agents may be developed. Conversely, genes deleted recurrently are candidate tumour suppressors, and therapeutic interventions may be designed against downstream pathways. Earlier studies aimed at identifying recurrent \gls{cna} or mutations did not identify any highly recurrent focal genetic lesions across medulloblastoma tumours (without classification into subtypes): most focal genetic lesions occur at frequency of less than 10\%, with \gene{MYC} amplification and \gene{PTCH1} mutation representing the most commonly observed events in medulloblastoma \citeref{northcott09, parsons11}. These observations suggest that medulloblastoma is genetic heterogeneous, and classifying medulloblastoma into molecular subgroups may aid the identification of genes and pathways that are recurrently disrupted above the background mutation rate in medulloblastoma.

The resulting segmentation profiles were further processed to reduce artificial segments. Segments with fewer than 10 markers were removed. Adjacent segments whose copy number states differed by less than 0.25 were merged together using their size-weighted mean. This merging step is repeated iteratively until no more segments can be merged. The segmentation profile of each sample was then median-centered. Further, normal CNVs reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV, v10) \citeref{iafrate04} were filtered from the segmentation profiles. Segments that reciprocally overlapped (Dice coefficient > 0.5) with normal CNVs were removed. CNVs reported on BAC End Sequencing, BAC Array CGH, ROMA, and FISH were excluded from this filter. Upon removing a segment, the upstream segment was merged to the downstream segment using a size-weighted mean. The aforementioned merging and CNV-filtering steps helped reduce the occurrence of broad segments being broken into non-contiguous pieces by artificial segments or normal CNVs (which influences the downstream GISTIC2 analysis and segment classification). The copy number segments were classified as balanced or one of 6 copy number aberrations based on the criteria in \citetab{cna-criteria}.

 The post-processed segmentation files profiles were analyzed using two algorithms, GISTIC2 and modified CMDS, to identify recurrent copy number events. GISTIC2 requires prior single-sample segmentation, and hence may be affected by the presence of segmentation artifacts. In contrast, CMDS requires no single-sample segmentation and works with the raw copy number profiles directly. Many post-processing steps were lacking from the distributed CMDS program (e.g. multiple hypothesis correction, peak calling, CNV filtering); therefore, a number of post-processing steps were added.
 
 GISTIC2 (v2.0.12) \citeref{mermel11} was run with default parameters unless specified otherwise (\code{brlen = 0.5, conf = 0.9}), on the segmentation profiles of the entire cohort and of each subgroup separately. The significant peaks were filtered based on the gene content ($ge 1$ gene spanned), size of the wide peak ($< 12$ Mbp), and additionally based on containment within a normal CNV region (one-way overlap $> 90$\%) reported in the filtered DGV database. This second CNV-filtering step ensures that amalgamated regions reported in DGV are considered, as these regions would often have poor reciprocal overlap with individual query segments and would be missed by the previous CNV-filtering procedure. It is not possible to apply this secondary CNV-filtering procedure directly on the segmentation file, as the CNV regions are often very large and this filtering can cause the loss of many informative CNA segments.

 CMDS (v1.0) \citeref{zhang10} was run using default parameters unless specified otherwise (\code{w = 40, s = 1}), on the unstratified and subgroup-stratified segmentation profiles, for each chromosome separately. Since the raw outputs had a high false positive rate, the outputs were processed further. The z-scores were recalculated (separately for each chromosome) from the Fisher’s z-transformed of the Pearson correlations, using the means of the dominant components from Gaussian mixture models ($k = 3$). This recalculation ensured that the z-scores were not skewed due to the presence of multiple modes in the raw output. The z-scores were further detrended using \gls{emd} \citeref{wu07}, which corrects for trends due to recurring broad events. The p-values derived from the z-scores were then corrected for multiple hypothesis correction using the qvalue R package (v1.1) \citeref{storey03}. Finally, the peak regions were identified using a simple q-value threshold ($FDR = 0.05$).

Several samples exhibited genomic aberrations reminiscent of chromothripsis, which has recently been implicated in cancer formation \citeref{stephens11, liu11, kloosterman11b, magrangeas11, crasta12, molenaar12}, as well as in medulloblastoma \citeself{rausch12}. In our cohort of chromothripsis, the incidence of chromothripsis is not uniform across subgroups ($p = 0.015$, Fisher's exact test). While the incidence of chromothripsis is depleted in WNT tumours compared to non-WNT tumours ($p = 0.0028$), chromothripsis is neither enriched nor depleted in the SHH, Group3, or Group4 ($p > 0.05$). The incidence of chromothripsis is about 12\% among SHH, Group3, and Group4 tumours. These findings are consistent with the observation that WNT medulloblastoma show no recurrent \gls{scna} other than chr6 loss and appear more genomically stable (\citefig{genome-coverage}) \citeself{shih12}.

-While \gene{MYC} amplification is a known pivotal player for Group3, our data indicate that others genes in close proximity to the \gene{MYC} locus may also play cooperative roles. This locus was frequently disrupted by a multitude of high-level amplicons \citeself{shih12} as well as massively genomic rearrangements termed chromothripsis (\citefig{chromothr_myc_wgs}). As a consequence of these events, the adjacent \gene{PVT1} gene and miR-1204 are frequently co-amplified with \gene{MYC}. Moreover, amplifications of the \gene{MYC}/\gene{PVT1} locus frequently result in the formation of fusion transcripts. Concurrent with MYC-PTV1 fusion expression, miR-1204 (hosted within PTV1) is upregulated \citeself{shih12}. \gene{MYC}, \gene{PVT1}, and miR-1204 all have been previously shown to play independent functional roles in other tumours \citeref{guan07,carramusa07,huppi08,barsotti12}, and may synergistically promote tumourigenesis.

 This study raised several bioinformatic challenges particularly due to the lack of germline samples. Owing to current and historical practices, the medulloblastoma samples amassed in this study were often not paired with germline samples. Fortunately, somatic and germline copy-number events are distinguishable on account of the rarity of large germline copy-number variants (spanning $> 1$ Mbp or $> 10$ probes) in the control population \citeself{shih12}. Additionally, we also dismissed copy-number variants observed in both cases and controls at high frequency ($> 90$\%). Identified germline copy-number variants were removed from copy-number profiles along with the breakpoints they introduced. However, despite our best efforts, some likely germline events and hybridization artifacts (unrelated to submission batch but possibly related to reagent lot) remain in the copy-number profiles of the samples. Nonetheless, with additional post-processing, careful curation, focus on high frequency events, and integration with multiple sources of evidence, we successfully identified recurrently disrupted genomic loci, though we caution against the isolated use of individual tumour copy-number profiles for future studies. The poor interpretability of individual copy-number events in a single tumour sample stems from non-systematic hybridization biases, poor sample DNA quality, the general genomic instability of some samples, and the notion that most genetic events during cancer evolution do not contribute to cancer cell survival and tumour formation. In light of these limitations, we prioritized genomic events observed frequently across multiple samples. Furthermore, we split samples into more homogeneous groups in order to identify such events above a background mutation rate. Indeed, we discovered significantly more recurrent \gls{cna} when the samples were split by subgroup than when they were analyzed together, reinforcing the utility of classifying medulloblastoma as four distinct diseases. To emphasize, we discovered patterns hidden in complex genomic profiles of tumours by comparing and contrasting biologically similar groups of samples.
 
-Another common issue that arises in cancer genomics studies is the role that genomic instability plays in tumour formation, progression, or recurrence. We considered different types of genomic instability separately and jointly, but we did not identify any significant and reproducible association between aneuploidy, frequent structural variations, or chromothripsis with patient survival (not shown). We contend that genomic instability in itself does not impact outcome, though the underlying cause or the consequent disruption of specific genes may affect tumour aggressiveness. For example, \gene{TP53} mutation may conduce to chromothripsis, but only the former portends poor outcome in multivariate survival analyses \citeref{shih14}. Chromothripsis does not exclusively occur in \gene{TP53} mutated cases; instead, it may be associated with mutations in other DNA damage response or repair genes, not all of which may contribute to tumour resistance against chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Further, chromothripsis in SHH medulloblastoma often results in amplification of \gene{GLI2}, but only the latter is independently prognostic for poor survival \citeref{shih14}. These findings in our medulloblastoma cohort contrast the association of chromothripsis with poorer survival (by univariate instead of multivariate analysis) in neuroblastoma \citeref{molenaar12}. Further, our pattern of chromothripsis incidence also contrasts that of a smaller cohort of medulloblastoma \citeref{rausch12}, in which the authors observed significantly higher frequency of chromothripsis in SHH medulloblastoma. In contrast, the incidence of chromothripsis is fairly uniform across SHH, Group3, and Group4 medulloblastomas and significantly depleted in WNT medulloblastoma. These results could be due to characteristic differences between the two cohorts of medulloblastoma examined. Both studies used the same method and algorithm to identify chromothripsis (the same researcher processed the raw SNP array data and made the chromothripsis calls in both studies). Given these discrepancies across studies, interactions among competing covariates may obscure meaningful interpretation, and recall biases in retrospective studies may skew distributions of specific variables, especially in studies with small sample sizes.

-Notwithstanding the technical, biological, and statistical challenges, we have successfully identified recurrent amplifications and deletions of genes that converge on specific signaling pathways contributing to tumourigenesis within each molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma. WNT medulloblastoma is surprisingly devoid of recurrent genomic aberrations aside from chr6 loss and \gene{CTNNB1} activating mutation. While the functional consequence of chr6 is unclear, the high frequency of \gene{CTNNB1} mutation suggest that activated \gls{wnt} signaling may be the predominant tumourigenic mechanism in WNT medulloblastoma. Similarly, recurrent \gls{cna} events converge on and conspire to activate \gls{shh} signaling in SHH medulloblastoma. In a subset of SHH cases, TP53 signaling and \gls{pi3k} signaling are also recurrently disrupted by \gls{cna}, and the latter may be a candidate pathway for therapeutic intervention against tumours with aberrations upstream of the drug target. The dominant theme in Group3 medulloblastoma is recurrent disruption of signaling of the super \gls{tgfb} family; in particular, \gls{cna} converge on activation of activin signaling, and this pathway may be the first rational candidate pathway for therapeutic intervention in this aggressive subgroup. While no signaling pathway is recurrently dysregulated in Group4 medulloblastoma, tandem duplications of \gene{SNCAIP} is frequently observed and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Group4 medulloblastoma. Taken together, copy-number profiling of medulloblastoma samples have led to the discovery of several frequently disrupted genes and pathways that may serve as candidates for targeted therapeutic intervention.

-The disparate patterns of recurrent \gls{cna} among medulloblastoma subgroups not only support the distinct etiologies of the subgroups but also raise questions regarding the origin of the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. Most recurrent \gls{cna} were enriched (observed at higher frequency) in specific subgroups but were not exclusively found in one subgroup. Further, unsupervised clustering by copy-number profiles produced groups that showed only modest agreement with the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma \citeself{shih12}. These results taken together suggest that the \gls{cna} events do not determine the molecular subgroups, though they may modulate the expression patterns of the subgroups. In contrast, DNA methylation patterns can identify, without supervision, four medulloblastoma classes that show high concordance with the molecular subgroups identified by expression patterns \citeref{hovestadt13, schwalbe13}. These results indicate that the epigenetic landscape in the cell of origin controls the expression patterns of the developing tumour and may also provide contexts that favours specific genomic aberrations, thus forming disparate genomic landscapes for each molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma.

 The Myc family of proto-oncogenes is amplified in a curious pattern across the medulloblastoma subgroups, and this pattern poses a question regarding whether and how epigenetic patterns influence amplification patterns of the Myc family, comprising \gene{MYC}, \gene{MYCN}, and \gene{MYCL}. These homologous genes were found to be amplified in lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and lung carcinoma, respectively, which possibly points to functional differences in Myc family proteins in diverse cancer types. Similarly, Myc family genes are amplified in a non-random pattern in medulloblastoma: \gene{MYC} is amplified predominately (albeit not exclusively) in Group3, \gene{MYCN} is amplified preferentially in SHH and Group4 medulloblastomas, and rare \gene{MYCL} amplifications are observed only in SHH medulloblastoma. At the expression level, most medulloblastomas of either WNT or Group3 subgroup upregulate RNA expression of MYC independent of DNA amplification. Similarly, SHH medulloblastomas express MYCN at a higher level than other subgroups and normal cerebellums even without \gene{MYCN} amplification. 
-In neuroblastoma, \gene{MYCN} amplification is found in about 20\% of cases \citeref{brodeur84, molenaar12}, but amplification of \gene{MYC} or \gene{MYCL} is very rarely observed \citeref{molenaar12}. These observations raise the question of why \gene{MYC}, \gene{MYCN}, and \gene{MYCL} is preferentially dysregulated in one cancer type or subtype as compared to another. Conceivably, Myc family genes could interact with different sets of co-transcription factors, drive dissimilar transcriptional programs, and cooperate with dysregulation of disparate signaling pathways in promoting tumour formation. Accordingly, the amplification of different Myc family genes could modulate the expression patterns of the medulloblastoma subgroups.

Additionally, genes nearby the \gene{MYC} or \gene{MYCN} locus can modulate the effect of amplifications spanning these loci.
 
-An alternative hypothesis is that differential accessibilities at genomic loci in the cell of origin govern which of the three human Myc family gene is amplified. Under this model, \gene{MYCN} amplification preferentially occur in SHH medulloblastoma because \gene{MYCN} is expressed in the cell of origin for SHH medulloblastoma (e.g. external granule neural precursor) during normal development, rendering the genomic locus accessible to such enzymes as deaminases (e.g. \gene{AICDA}, \gene{APOBEC}), which initiate double-strand breaks that can ultimately lead to DNA rearrangement. Similarly, \gene{MYC} amplification may preferentially occur in Group3 medulloblastoma because the \gene{MYC} locus is permissible to structural rearrangement. In other words, the observed patterns of Myc family gene amplification arise mainly due to variations in accessibility of these genomic loci in different cells of origin instead of functional differences among Myc family members. Consistent with this model, MYCN is functionally redundant with MYC, and knock-in of \gene{MYCN} into the \gene{MYC} locus rescues the loss of \gene{MYC} in mouse development, cell growth, and cell differentiation \citeref{malynn00}. \gene{MYC} and \gene{MYCN} double knock-out mice exhibit much more severe phenotype in neurogenesis than either one alone \citeref{wey10}. Further, \gene{MYC} and \gene{MYCN} are interchangeable in promoting tumour formation. \gene{MYCN} coding region can substitute for that of \gene{MYC} in the transformation of pro-B cell \citeref{gostissa09}. Similarly, MYC can cooperative with SHH ligand to enhance formation of SHH medulloblastoma in a virus-induced mouse tumour model, despite that \gene{MYC} amplification is rarely observed in human SHH medulloblastoma \citeref{rao03, shih12}. Therefore, Myc family genes may indeed encode functionally similar proteins that promote medulloblastoma formation by a common mechanism.

Therefore, Myc family genes may indeed encode functionally similar proteins (whose transcriptional regulation may differ) that promote medulloblastoma formation by a common mechanism.
 
-Despite being an important player in transforming normals cells into cancer or in inducing pluripotency in differentiated cells, a Myc family gene may exert different effects in different tumour contexts. In Group3 medulloblastoma, \gene{MYC} amplification is associated with poorer survival. However, \gene{MYCN} amplification is associated with poorer survival only in SHH medulloblastoma but not in Group4 medulloblastoma. The amplification of a Myc family gene is thus not universally associated with poorer outcome, and the function of Myc in medulloblastoma may be modulated by cooperating disruption of other pathways in the tumour-initiating cell and by extracellular signals in the context of neural development.

-The story of the Myc family illustrates a broader theme of how genomic alterations lead to different subgroups of medulloblastoma. \gene{MYC} amplifications can drive tumour formation, but only in the suitable cellular context and with other cooperating mutations \citeref{rao03, pei12}. Indeed, \gene{MYC} and \gene{SHH} overexpression are sufficient to induce tumour formation in the external granule layer of the cerebellum but not in the cerebrum \citeref{rao03}. Accordingly, MYC overexpression likely do not create Group3 medulloblastoma. Rather, the (possibly multiple) cells of origin and cooperating alterations provide the necessary context for the amplification of \gene{MYC} and consequent induction of medulloblastoma, and they dictate the molecular subgroup identity of the resulting tumour. Similarly, \gene{MYCN} amplification is a common mechanism of tumourigenesis in subsets of SHH and Group4 medulloblastoma cases, and this genetic event does not induce an overwhelming transcriptional change that by itself justifies the definition of an distinct molecular subgroup. Indeed, gene amplification of the Myc family does not create a transcriptionally homogeneous entity that is distinct from other molecular subgroups. The functional outcome of Myc amplification very much depends on the molecular subgroup of the tumour in which Myc amplification occurs \citeself{shih14}. In experimental models, Myc family overexpression, along with cooperating mutations, can likely transform multiple cells of origin, and the subgroup of the resulting tumour would likely be determined by the cellular origin rather than the Myc family member. More generally, tumours of specific subtypes arise due to interaction between genetics and context. The cellular origin provides the permissive context for genomic alterations to exert their effects, and the nuclear organization, epigenetic landscape, chromatin architecture within the cell of origin likely influence the accessibility of genomic loci and shape the mutational landscape of the cancer cell \citeref{polak15}.

 In summary, medulloblastoma subgroups are characterized by distinct genomic alterations that disrupt disparate signaling pathways. The mutational profiles do not define each subgroup; instead, they are shaped by the molecular and cellular context within each subgroup, and the functional consequences of the mutations may also depend on the molecular subgroup. Hence, genes and pathways that are recurrently disrupted by genomic alterations within each subgroup likely play pivotal roles in the formation and perhaps maintenance of the tumours, and such genes and pathways serve as prime candidates for design of rational, targeted therapeutic intervention.

 \chapter{Conclusions and future directions}
 \label{ch:conclusions}
 
-The discovery of the four molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma has paved the road for the informed development of specific targeted therapy and promises hope for achieving personalized medicine in the treatment of medulloblastoma, where each patient will receive an individualized regimen that maximizes efficacy and minimizes side-effects. Medulloblastomas, not unlike many other malignancies, arises due to a multitude of genetic aberrations, leading to disruptions of biological processes that differ from patient to patient. These aberrations begin to form clear patterns when viewed against the backdrop of molecular subgroup. To streamline scientific research and clinical practice, we hope to introduce molecular classification in the clinic. Currently, two major obstacles in the adoption of molecular subgroup classification in the clinic are the lack of applicable biospecimen for genomic analysis and the discrepancy in quality control standards between research and clinical labs. To overcome these challenges, we have tested and validated an assay suitable for subgroup classifcation of \gls{ffpe} samples, and we have implemented rigorous quality control to ensure that the assay results are reproducible, credible, and suitable for guiding clinical decision-making. If molecular subgroup information does not influence clinical treatment, however, the assay would have little clinical utility. We have therefore identified, through genomic profiling, actionable signalling pathways within medulloblastoma subgroups that may serve as rational targets for future therapeutic development. To further fuel the motivation for classifying medulloblastoma subgroups in the clinic, we have identified molecular biomarkers that, together with clinical biomarkers, sucessuflly stratify patients into risk groups using schemes specific to each molecular subgroup and attain unprecedented prognostic accuracy. Accordingly, we have addressed some of the challenges that face the treatment of patients with medulloblastoma and provided evidence that supports the classification of medulloblastoma by molecular subgroups in the clinic. We hope that the adoption of molecular classification will inform the next generation of clinical trials and facilitate the development of personalized targeted therapy.
+The discovery of the four molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma has paved the road for the informed development of specific targeted therapy and promises hope for achieving personalized medicine in the treatment of medulloblastoma, where each patient will receive an individualized regimen that maximizes efficacy and minimizes side-effects. Medulloblastomas, not unlike many other malignancies, arise due to a multitude of genetic aberrations, leading to disruptions of biological processes that differ from patient to patient.

-While in pursuit of this long-term goal, we need to address some remaining questions regarding the classification of medulloblastoma. While anatomical location and histology will likely remain an integral core of \gls{cns} tumour classification, numerous other ways of categorizing cancer present the problem of choosing or appropriately integrating classification schemes. One alternative classification of medulloblastoma could be based on genetic alterations, as in many other cancer types. While some genes identifies a cancer type -- \gene{RB1} (retinoblastoma) and \gene{SMARCB1} (\gls{atrt}) -- other genes may be less useful for defining cancer types. For example, \gene{TP53} mutation or loss leads to a spectrum of tumours, and restoring TP53 function will not restore the genomic damages already incurred. Additionally, given that most observed mutations in cancer likely do not contribute to tumourigenesis, identifying and validating tumourigenic mutations may be difficult without first grouping cancers into sufficiently homogeneous subtypes. Moreover, disruption of multiple genes in the same pathway may lead to the same molecular phenotype, and it can be difficult to identify recurrently disrupted pathways prior to molecular classification \citeself{shih12}. The most problematic issue for defining medulloblastoma based on genetic alterations is the relatively low frequency of most mutations.  Conversely, epigenetic profiles may reflect the cellular origin that shape the genomic landscape of the tumour, and it may be useful for classification of medulloblastoma. Encouragingly, DNA methylation profiles define very similar subtypes as RNA expression profiles, suggesting that both may be integrated to develop a more robust molecular classification of medulloblastoma.

-Since medulloblastoma is now classified into four molecular subgroups, mouse models of medulloblastoma would also need to be classified into the same subgroups. Numerous mouse models purport to recapitulate a specific molecular subgroup of human medulloblastoma, \citeself{he14, chow14, northcott14, natarajan13} but the molecular subgroup of some mouse models are contested \citeref{poschl14}. Better comparative transcriptomics may therefore be needed to resolve controversies surrounding mouse models of medulloblastoma (and similarly for other cancers or diseases). We would need to move beyond mere descriptions of the conservation or divergence of transcriptional programs and  attempt to draw parallels between human and mouse transcriptomes in order to more precisely identify conserved molecular mechanisms and enable specific hypotheses regarding human diseases to be tested in mouse models.

-Concurrent with ongoing scientific inquiries, the search for more effective therapy for medulloblastoma continues. With the recognition that medulloblastoma comprises four different diseases, many prospective trials are now testing emerging therapies for specific medulloblastoma subgroups, consistent with the spirit of precision medicine. For Group3 medulloblastoma, an \emph{in vitro} drug screened identified  pemetrexed and gemcitabine as a potential combination therapy, and this combination showed efficacy in mouse models of Group3 medulloblastoma (but not SHH medulloblastoma) \citeref{morfouace14}. Similarly, BET bromodomain inhibition of \gene{MYC}-amplified medulloblastoma is currently under investigation \citeref{bandopadhayay14}. For SHH medulloblastoma, SMO inhibitors (e.g. vismodegib and sonidegib) showed some efficacy and present a promising avenue for further development. \citeref{kieran14, gajjar13, rodon14, amakye13}. Further, mouse models of SHH medulloblastoma appear sensitive to inhibition of Auroa and Polo-like kinases \citeself{markant13} or inhibition of BIRC5 (survivin) \citeref{brun14}. In order to expand the arsenal of anti-cancer drugs, it may be prudent to consider administering candidate drugs before standard combination chemotherapy in future clinical trials, as precedent exists for drugs to be effective against untreated tumours but not recurrent tumours. For example, topotecan (topoisomerase inhibitor) is ineffective in recurrent medulloblastoma \citeref{kadota99, blaney96} but is effective upfront in untreated, high-risk medulloblastoma \citeref{stewart04}. In trials of novel therapy on untreated medulloblastoma, salvage treatment with chemotherapy should of course be planned so that patient survival is not compromised; furthermore, prior trials on replacing radiotherapy with chemotherapy would provide invaluable insight for planning salvage treatments. Past clinical experiences and novel scientific knowledge will together help usher in a new era of medulloblastoma treatment based on individualized targeted therapy that enhances the quality of care and preserves the quality of life for the patients.

 % Since high-quality biological specimens of medulloblastoma rare and clinical diagnostic practices differ among treatment centres, we hope to able to identify some medulloblastoma samples with partial information. Unified classifier includes expression, DNA methylation, copy-number aberrations and other features (CTNNB1 nuclear localization, histological staining?). This is to be distinguished from typical integrated approaches where all data types are needed; here, the unified approaches uses whatever data that is available.
