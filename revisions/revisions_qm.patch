 We sought to develop a method for classifying medulloblastoma samples into the four molecular subgroups. This method consists of two components: an experimental assay for measuring marker expression and a computational classifier for assigning molecular subgroup to an unknown medulloblastoma sample. We used the nanoString nCounter technology \citeref{geiss08} to directly measure the expression level of 22 subgroup-specific marker genes, each of which is overexpressed in one of the four molecular subgroups. We then selected the optimal classification algorithm from a panel of algorithms by comparing cross-validation accuracies. Subsequently, we validated the trained classifier on external datasets of medulloblastoma samples with independently assigned molecular subgroups.
 
-We did not use expression microarrays for measuring RNA expression because they have long been considered tools ill-suited for clinical diagnostics \citeref{shi08, deronde10, weigelt10, ein-dor06, frantz05, michiels05, ioannidis05, marshall04, check04, tan03, tilstone03}. While the aforementioned class-discovery studies used expression arrays (Affymetrix U133 or Exon ST 1.0) to measure the expression of all protein-coding genes (more than 20~000), we only needed, for our purpose, to measure the expression of genes that help discriminate between the molecular subgroups.  Reducing the number of genes to be measured simultaneously reduces the number of hybridizing probes, which in turn mitigates the potential for cross-hybridization (binding of probes to sequences other than the target sequence). Critically, expression microarrays typically require fresh-frozen samples and perform poorly on \gls{ffpe} samples. Even on microarray platforms specifically designed for \gls{ffpe} samples, the signal-to-noise ratios of \gls{ffpe} samples are generally poor. Formalin fixation and paraffin embedding preserve cellular and tissue architecture but cause extensive degradation of nucleic acids, especially RNA. Furthermore, microarrays are plagued by complex and diverse preprocessing procedures (probe signal normalization and subsequent processing), in addition to experiment-specific effects (unwanted variations). All these limitations preclude the widespread adoption of microarrays in diagnostic laboratories. Conversely, the nanoString technology is less sensitive to RNA degradation and provides high reproducibility between experiments.

-The nanoString platform provide high-quality measurements of RNA expression and differs from expression microarrays in important ways \citeref{geiss08}. In nanoString, the probes are custom designed to a relatively small set of target gene transcripts, and the cross-hybridization limitation of microarrays can be circumvented in part by reducing the number of hybridization targets and designing probes against non-homologous sequences \citeref{bishop08, li05, geiss08}. nanoString measures transcript abundance directly while expression microarrays require \emph{in vitro} transcription (or reverse transcription) and \gls{pcr} amplification. These enzymatic reactions can introduce bias (e.g. GC content bias) and variation (e.g. stochastic amplification by \gls{pcr}). Additionally, in an nanoString assay, transcripts are detected by the simultaneous binding of a pair of probes (a fluorescent-labeled reporter probe and a biotinylated capture probe) in solution (i.e. 3-dimensional space); for expression arrays in comparison, each target sequence binds to one immobilized probe on a 2-dimensional surface (chip or bead). (Mismatch probes present in older microarray designs such as Affymetrix U133 are often ignored during data normalization, and they have been eliminated in newer designs such as Affymetrix Exon ST 1.0. Notably, newer expression platforms also typically contain probes targeting multiple regions of a gene in order to achieve higher redundancy.) These differences in hybridization allow nanoString to achieve higher specificity and sensitivity, especially for \gls{ffpe} tissue \citeref{geiss08}.

These properties of nanoString may potentially explain why nanoString can achieve reliable quantitation on \gls{ffpe} tissue \citeref{reis11}.
 
 While clustering analysis has been instrumental in \emph{discovering} the molecular classes of medulloblastoma, it is ill-suited for predicting the class of a new, unknown sample. (See page \pageref{sec:classification} in the \textbf{Appendix} for the distinction between \emphterm{class discovery} and \emphterm{class prediction}.)  Clustering analysis can be sensitive to changes in sample size: removal or addition of samples can drastically influence the clustering results. The inclusion of samples with poor quality measurements may also completely reorganize the clustering structure. Moreover, clustering analysis is prone to batch effects, where the discovered classes represent different technical batches of samples and do not reflect underlying biology. In comparison, class prediction can mitigate these effects by selecting for features that discriminate between the different classes and by assessing training and testing accuracies separately. Admittedly, clustering algorithms can be adapted for class prediction, but existing classification algorithms are applied more widely, tested more extensively, and understood more deeply. Furthermore, model-based classifiers can be designed under the classification framework in order to exploit specific statistical properties of the input data and thus improve prediction accuracy. Above all, we prefer to use or refine a ready suitable tool rather than to re-purpose a tool designed for another task.
 
-We show that our method can accurately predict the molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma samples. The method is reproducible across different nanoString service centres and across different datasets. The assays only cost about \$50 a sample at a throughput up to 100 samples a week. Thus, we have developed a molecular classification method for medulloblastoma that is rapid, reliable, and reproducible, and this method can be readily adopted for use in a diagnostic laboratory.

Primary medulloblastomas comprising the training series for nanoString ($n = 101$) have been previously described \citeref{northcott11a}. Samples contributing to the validation series ($n = 131$) have been previously described and were obtained as total RNA extracted from fresh-frozen tissue from the DKFZ (Heidelberg, Germany; Remke series, $n = 56$) \citeref{remke11}, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, USA; Cho series, $n = 39$) \citeref{cho11}, and Marcel Kool (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany; Kool series, $n = 36$) \citeref{kool08}.  \gls{ffpe} cases ($n = 84$) were obtained as paraffin sections from the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Canada; $n = 34$), John’s Hopkins University (Baltimore, USA; $n = 25$), and the DKFZ (Heidelberg, Germany; $n = 25$).

 \subsection{nanoString data processing and class prediction}
 
-Raw nanoString counts for each gene within each experiment were centered using geometric means of the counts obtained for positive control probe sets prior to a biological normalization using the three housekeeping genes included in the CodeSet.  Normalized data were log2-transformed and used as input for class prediction analysis (zero counts were mapped to zero).
+Raw nanoString values were log-transformed (zero counts were mapped to zero). For each raw log\low{2} value $x^{(i)}$ in sample $i$ of $n$ total samples, the normalized value $\tilde{x}^{(i)}$ is calculated as
+\[
+\tilde{x}^{(i)} = x^{(i)} - p^{(i)} + p - b^{(i)} + b
+\]
+where $p^{(i)}$ is the mean signal from the positive control probes in sample $i$, and $b^{(i)}$ is the mean signal from the three endogenous biological control probes targeting housekeeping genes (LHDA, GAPDH, and ACTB) in sample $i$. Additionally, $p$ and $b$ are the mean positive control and biological control signals across all $n$ samples in the dataset.
+\[
+p = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n p^{(i)} \,\,\,\,\,\,
+b = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n b^{(i)}
+\]
+Following normalization of nanoString counts using all samples, the normalized log2 expression values were used for downstream class prediction analysis.
 
 A series of medulloblastomas with known subgroup affiliation ($n = 101$) were used to establish a training dataset for subsequent class prediction analysis of independent cohorts used in the study. Various class prediction algorithms were assessed by a 10-fold cross-validation scheme, using a set of scoring indices to establish a pipeline for predicting medulloblastoma subgroups with nanoString data derived from the training series. Based on superior performance in cross-validation analysis, the PAM method was selected for all downstream class prediction analyses.
 
-All class prediction analyses were performed in the R statistical programming environment (v2.13). Implementations of the class prediction algorithms were imported from the following R packages: MASS v7.3 (linear discriminant analysis; LDA), class v7.3 (k-nearest neighbor; KNN), e1071 v1.5 (support vector machine; SVM), nnet v7.3 (multinomial log-linear model; MULT), and pamr v1.51 (prediction analysis for microarrays; PAM) \citeref{tibshirani02}. During cross-validation, the training set of 101 samples was randomly split into 10 partitions. Each class predictor was trained on nine of the partitions, and the performance of the predictor was subsequently tested on the one remaining partition. Each of the 10 partitions was used as the testing set in turn for a round of cross-validation, for a total of 10,000 rounds of cross-validation, which was repeated 3 times with reproducible results.
-
-The scoring indices used during testing were simple accuracy, Jaccard similarity index, Rand index, adjusted Rand index, and Fowlkes–Mallows index. The latter four indices are different indices for determining the similarity between two groupings, which are the known and predicted classifications of samples in the current analysis. These indices serve as more stringent measures of accuracy in multiclass prediction. Aside from the aforementioned measures of accuracy, the reliabilities of the classifiers were also determined using Shannon entropy as a measure of uncertainty. Classifiers with varying predicted classes for the same sample across cross-validation rounds have higher entropy values and are hence less reliable.
-
-Since the model parameters for SVM can affect the prediction performance, these parameters were optimized by a grid search in a separate round of cross-validation. The ranges of searched parameter values were: $[2^{-5}, 2^{15}]$ for \code{C}; $[2^{-15}, 2^3]$ for \code{gamma}; $[2, 8]$ for \code{degree}; $[-1, 1]$ for \code{coef0}. Further, SVM using different kernels (linear, radial basis, polynomial, and sigmoid) were assessed, and the kernel with the best performance was selected. Similarly for KNN, the best model was selected from models with different $k$.

Each class predictor was trained on nine of the partitions, and the performance of the predictor was subsequently tested on the one remaining partition. Each of the 10 partitions was used as the testing set once in a round of cross-validation. This cross-validation process was repeated for a total of 10,000 partitionings. The entire experiment was repeated at least 3 times with reproducible results.

+The scoring indices used during testing were simple accuracy, Jaccard similarity index, Rand index, adjusted Rand index, and Fowlkes–Mallows index. The latter four indices are different indices for determining the similarity between two groupings, which are the known and predicted classifications of samples in the current analysis. These indices serve as more stringent measures of accuracy in multiclass prediction. Aside from the aforementioned measures of accuracy, the reliability of a classifier was also determined using Shannon entropy as a measure of uncertainty:
+\[
+H(Y) = - \sum_{y \in Y} P(y) \; log_2 P(y)
+\]
+where $Y$ is taken to be the predicted class label of the classifier for a given sample. Accordingly, $P(y)$ is estimated by the empirical frequency that the classifier predicts the sample to be class $y$ across all cross-validation rounds. The mean entropy value for a classifier is averaged across all training samples.
+Hence, classifiers with varying predicted classes for the same sample across cross-validation rounds have higher entropy values and are hence less reliable.
+
+Since the model parameters for SVM can affect the prediction performance, these parameters were optimized by a grid search in a separate round of cross-validation for SVMs with linear, radial basis, polynomial, and sigmoid kernels for observations $\vect{x}_i$ and $\vect{x}_j$ as shown below.

 \subsection{Regression analysis of prediction accuracy}
 
-Cumulative prediction accuracy was modeled as a function of FFPE sample age. The prediction accuracies were first calculated for each sample age year-group. The cumulative accuracies were determined by calculating the cumulative sum of the accuracies, weighted by the size of each year-group. The data were fitted using a 5-parameter logistic regression model, as implemented in the drc v2.1 R package. The maximum asymptote parameter (\code{D}) was constrained at 1 in order to reflect the high accuracy the predictor achieved with recent FFPE samples.
+Define $c_t$ as the number of correctly classified samples and $n_t$ as the number of samples with age $x_i \le t$
+\[
+n_t = \sum_i I(x_i \le t)
+\]
+\[
+c_t = \sum_i I(x_i \le t \; \cap \; i \in \mathbb{C})
+\]
+where $i$ iterates over samples, $I(\cdot)$ is the indicator function, $\mathbb{C}$ is the set of correctly classified samples.
+Cumulative accuracies were calculated for each sample age year bin $t$ as $y_t = c_t / n_t$, and $y_t$ was fitted as a 5-parameter logistic function of $t$, using the implementation in the drc v2.1 R package:
+\[
+f(t) = \gamma + \frac{\delta - \gamma}{(1 + exp( \beta (log(t) - log(\epsilon)) ))^\zeta}
+\]
+The maximum asymptote parameter $\delta$ was constrained at 1 in order to reflect the high accuracy that the predictor achieved with recent \gls{ffpe} samples. 
 
 \subsection{Outlier detection}
 
-A Gaussian mixture model was fitted to the mean endogenous-control signals and the mean positive-control signals of all collected nanoString data to establish the reference ranges for the endogenous and positive controls. Samples with mean endogenous-control or positive-control signals that deviate significantly from the respective reference range at a significance level of 0.001 were identified as outliers.

 \section{Results}
 
-In order to select a classification algorithm that predicts most accurately and reliably, we evaluated the class prediction performance of a panel of well-known classifiers: \gls{svm}, \gls{lda}, multinomial logistic regression, \gls{knn}, \gls{pam}. (Note that \gls{pam} is to be distinguished from the clustering algorithm, partitioning around medoids; \gls{lda} is also to be distinguished from latent Dirichlet allocation, another unsupervised learning algorithm.) These classifiers were trained on a training set of 101 fresh-frozen medulloblastoma samples with known molecular subgroups. Classifiers that have tuning parameters (\gls{svm}, \gls{pam}, and \gls{knn}) were tuned using a round of 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of all classifiers were assessed using repeated, stratified, 10-fold cross-validation using various measures of accuracy. \gls{pam} consistently showed superior performance to all other classifiers. Its predictions are most consistent across multiple rounds of cross-validation, indicating that its predictions are reliable. In comparison, multinomial logistic regression predicted different subgroups for the same sample when it was trained on different subsets of the training data, illustrating that it does not generalize well and its predictions are unreliable. Further, the test accuracy of the \gls{pam} algorithm as assessed by cross-validation was the highest. Admittedly, the test accuracies of all classification algorithms were high and roughly in the same range, though \gls{pam} consistently outperformed all the other classifiers in repeated rounds of cross-validation.

 Therefore, we proceeded to evaluate the performance of the trained \gls{pam} classifier on external datasets of medulloblastoma samples with independently assigned molecular subgroups. The original molecular subtypes from the previous studies were mapped to the consensus molecular subgroups using the mapping detailed in the consensus report \citeref{taylor12}. The performance of the trained classifier was tested on an external set of 130 fresh-frozen medulloblastoma samples. By testing on an external validation set that is disjoint from the training set, we show that our classifier generalizes well and is insensitive to irrelevant variability across datasets. Indeed, our method achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98\% (\citefig{nanostr-valid}).

+Candidate prognositic markers, including all cytogenetic events, focal copy-number events, and all clinical features, were first tested by univariate survival analyses (log-rank tests) individually.

The optimal survival models for each medulloblastoma subgroup were determined by unbiased model selection procedures: stepwise regression using forward selection, backward elimination, and bidirectional elimination. To make the final model practical for use with \gls{fish} in diagnostic laboratories, a maximum of three cytogenetic or copy-number markers were included in each candidate model. The selected models were compared by analyses of deviance tests to determine the model that best fits the discovery cohort. Finally, the survival data was re-analyzed by the optimal model in order to assess the survival of patients with each combination of variable levels; the risk-stratification trees were manually designed in order to group patients into distinct risk groups.

 To integrate the individual biomarkers into a risk stratification model, multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analyses were performed on all significant prognostic markers. Through multiple stepwise regression procedures, a consensus set of biomarkers was selected for inclusion in the model in an unbiased manner. The proposed risk stratification scheme represents the model that was most consistent with available data in the discovery cohort, from among many possible alternatives (\citefig{shh-risk-strat}\emphlab{a}) \citeself{shih14}. \gene{GLI2} amplification, chr14q loss, and leptomeningeal dissemination (M+ disease) identify high and standard risk patients. Specifically, \gene{GLI2} amplification alone can identify patients with bleak prognosis (\citefig{shh-risk-strat}\emphlab{a}) \citeself{shih14}. Absence of these markers demarcates a low-risk group of patients who exhibit survivorship reminiscent of WNT patients. Importantly, none of the covariates, particularly age and anaplastic histology, can explain the survival differences observed among the risk groups (\citefig{shh-risk-strat}\emphlab{a}) \citeself{shih14}. Direct application of the proposed risk stratification scheme on the independent validation cohort yields distinct survivorships for the three risk groups, thereby validating the model (\citefig{shh-risk-strat}\emphlab{c}).

 \section{Discussion}
 
-The analysis of $> 1000$ medulloblastoma patients clearly demonstrates that subgroup affiliation enhances prognostication with clinical biomarkers and that the majority of published molecular biomarkers are only relevant in the setting of a single subgroup. The combination of clinical variables, molecular subgroup, and six cytogenetic markers analyzed on \gls{ffpe} tissues can achieve an unprecedented level of prognostic prediction for medulloblastoma patients that is practical, reliable, and reproducible. The proposed risk stratification models represent those that best fit the available data in the discovery cohort. The performances of our models are robust against the choice of prognostic markers. Despite the large size of our discovery cohort, missing data and the complexity of multivariate analyses may necessitate the use of even larger cohorts to assess the inclusion of additional prognostic markers. Moreover, while we strive to include the most important markers in multivariate models, we cannot exclude the possibility that alternative markers may perform equally well. Our results nonetheless elucidate the prognostic potential of known and novel markers and highlight clinically useful risk-stratification schemes.

 The prognostic significance of M1 status (presence of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid) has long been controversial. Most reports agree that presence of metastasis portends poor prognosis and warrants intensified treatment \citeref{grill05, rutkowski05, salama06, rutkowski10, kool12, pietsch14, vonhoff09, bouffet94, zeltzer99}; however, it is unclear whether M1 disease has the same prognosis as M2/M3 (macroscopic metastasis). Kortmann \emph{et al.}\ contended in a prospective trial that M2/M3 status were indicators of poor outcome in medulloblastoma, but residual disease or M1 status were not \citeref{kortmann00}. In another prospective trial, Zeltzer \emph{et al.}\ maintained that both M1 and M2/M3 statuses were prognostically unfavourable \citeref{zeltzer99}. In subsequent studies, some investigators group M0 and M1 together in one category \citeref{rutkowski05, pietsch14}, while others group M1, M2 and M3 together as M+ \citeref{rutkowski10, kool12, pietsch14, strother14}. In a retrospective review, Sanders \emph{et al.}\ reported that M1 patients do not have better survival than M2/M3 patients under the same treatment \citeref{sanders08}. In our cohorts, the prognostic significance of M1 disease may be subgroup specific, though the small sample size of M1 patients hinders a definitive conclusion \citeself{shih14}. Based on our data, it is unlikely that M1 status is a universal indicator of poor outcome. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether M1 was categorized with M0 or M2/M3, our risk-stratification models can reproducibly and robustly predict patient survival.

 \section{Discussion}
 
 This study raised several bioinformatic challenges particularly due to the lack of germline samples. Owing to current and historical practices, the medulloblastoma samples amassed in this study were often not paired with germline samples. Fortunately, somatic and germline copy-number events are distinguishable on account of the rarity of large germline copy-number variants (spanning $> 1$ Mbp or $> 10$ probes) in the control population \citeself{shih12}. Additionally, we also dismissed copy-number variants observed in both cases and controls at high frequency ($> 90$\%). Identified germline copy-number variants were removed from copy-number profiles along with the breakpoints they introduced. However, despite our best efforts, some likely germline events and hybridization artifacts (unrelated to submission batch but possibly related to reagent lot) remain in the copy-number profiles of the samples. Nonetheless, with additional post-processing, careful curation, focus on high frequency events, and integration with multiple sources of evidence, we successfully identified recurrently disrupted genomic loci, though we caution against the isolated use of individual tumour copy-number profiles for future studies. The poor interpretability of individual copy-number events in a single tumour sample stems from non-systematic hybridization biases, poor sample DNA quality, the general genomic instability of some samples, and the notion that most genetic events during cancer evolution do not contribute to cancer cell survival and tumour formation. In light of these limitations, we prioritized genomic events observed frequently across multiple samples. Furthermore, we split samples into more homogeneous groups in order to identify such events above a background mutation rate. Indeed, we discovered significantly more recurrent \gls{cna} when the samples were split by subgroup than when they were analyzed together, reinforcing the utility of classifying medulloblastoma as four distinct diseases. To emphasize, we discovered patterns hidden in complex genomic profiles of tumours by comparing and contrasting biologically similar groups of samples.
 
-Another common issue that arises in cancer genomics studies is the role that genomic instability plays in tumour formation, progression, or recurrence. We considered different types of genomic instability separately and jointly, but we did not identify any significant and reproducible association between aneuploidy, frequent structural variations, or chromothripsis with patient survival (not shown). We contend that genomic instability in itself does not impact outcome, though the underlying cause or the consequent disruption of specific genes may affect tumour aggressiveness. For example, \gene{TP53} mutation may conduce to chromothripsis, but only the former portends poor outcome in multivariate survival analyses \citeref{shih14}. Chromothripsis does not exclusively occur in \gene{TP53} mutated cases; instead, it may be associated with mutations in other DNA damage response or repair genes, not all of which may contribute to tumour resistance against chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Further, chromothripsis in SHH medulloblastoma often results in amplification of \gene{GLI2}, but only the latter is independently prognostic for poor survival \citeref{shih14}. These findings in our medulloblastoma cohort contrast the association of chromothripsis with poorer survival (by univariate instead of multivariate analysis) in neuroblastoma \citeref{molenaar12}. Further, our pattern of chromothripsis incidence also contrasts that of a smaller cohort of medulloblastoma \citeref{rausch12}, in which the authors observed significantly higher frequency of chromothripsis in SHH medulloblastoma. In contrast, the incidence of chromothripsis is fairly uniform across SHH, Group3, and Group4 medulloblastomas and significantly depleted in WNT medulloblastoma. These results could be due to characteristic differences between the two cohorts of medulloblastoma examined. Both studies used the same method and algorithm to identify chromothripsis (the same researcher processed the raw SNP array data and made the chromothripsis calls in both studies). Interactions among competing covariates may obscure meaningful interpretation and may explain the observed discrepancies across studies; furthermore, recall biases in retrospective studies may skew distributions of specific variables, especially in studies with small sample sizes.

 Notwithstanding the technical, biological, and statistical challenges, we have successfully identified recurrent amplifications and deletions of genes that converge on specific signaling pathways contributing to tumourigenesis within each molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma. WNT medulloblastoma is surprisingly devoid of recurrent genomic aberrations aside from chr6 loss and \gene{CTNNB1} activating mutation. While the functional consequence of chr6 is unclear, the high frequency of \gene{CTNNB1} mutation suggest that activated \gls{wnt} signaling may be the predominant tumourigenic mechanism in WNT medulloblastoma. Similarly, recurrent \gls{cna} events converge on and conspire to activate \gls{shh} signaling in SHH medulloblastoma. In a subset of SHH cases, TP53 signaling and \gls{pi3k} signaling are also recurrently disrupted by \gls{cna}, and the latter may be a candidate pathway for therapeutic intervention against tumours with aberrations upstream of the drug target. The dominant theme in Group3 medulloblastoma is recurrent disruption of signaling of the super \gls{tgfb} family; in particular, \gls{cna} converge on activation of activin signaling, and this pathway may be the first rational candidate pathway for therapeutic intervention in this aggressive subgroup. While no signaling pathway is highly recurrently dysregulated in Group4 medulloblastoma, tandem duplications of \gene{SNCAIP} is frequently observed and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Group4 medulloblastoma. Taken together, copy-number profiling of medulloblastoma samples have led to the discovery of several frequently disrupted genes and pathways that may serve as candidates for targeted therapeutic intervention.
 
-The disparate patterns of recurrent \gls{cna} among medulloblastoma subgroups not only support the distinct etiologies of the subgroups but also raise questions regarding the origin of the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. Most recurrent \gls{cna} were enriched (observed at higher frequency) in specific subgroups but were not exclusively found in one subgroup. Further, unsupervised clustering by copy-number profiles produced groups that showed only modest agreement with the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma based on transcriptional profiles \citeself{shih12}. These results taken together suggest that the \gls{cna} events do not determine the molecular subgroups, though they may modulate the expression patterns of the subgroups. In contrast, DNA methylation patterns can identify, without supervision, four medulloblastoma classes that show high concordance with the molecular subgroups identified by expression patterns \citeref{hovestadt13, schwalbe13}. This finding indicates that the epigenetic landscape in the cell of origin controls the expression patterns of the developing tumour and may also provide contexts that favours specific genomic aberrations, thus forming disparate genomic landscapes for each molecular subgroup of medulloblastoma.

 The Myc family of proto-oncogenes is amplified in a curious pattern across the medulloblastoma subgroups, and this pattern poses a question regarding whether and how epigenetic patterns influence amplification patterns of the Myc family, comprising \gene{MYC}, \gene{MYCN}, and \gene{MYCL}. These homologous genes were found to be amplified in lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and lung carcinoma, respectively, which possibly points to functional differences in Myc family proteins in diverse cancer types. Similarly, Myc family genes are amplified in a non-random pattern in medulloblastoma: \gene{MYC} is amplified predominately (albeit not exclusively) in Group3, \gene{MYCN} is amplified preferentially in SHH and Group4 medulloblastomas, and rare \gene{MYCL} amplifications are observed only in SHH medulloblastoma. At the expression level, most medulloblastomas of either WNT or Group3 subgroup upregulate RNA expression of MYC independent of DNA amplification. Similarly, SHH medulloblastomas express MYCN at a higher level than other subgroups and normal cerebellums even without \gene{MYCN} amplification. 
 In neuroblastoma, \gene{MYCN} amplification is found in about 20\% of cases \citeref{brodeur84, molenaar12}, but amplification of \gene{MYC} or \gene{MYCL} is very rarely observed \citeref{molenaar12}. These observations raise the question of why \gene{MYC}, \gene{MYCN}, and \gene{MYCL} is preferentially dysregulated in one cancer type or subtype as compared to another. Conceivably, Myc family genes could interact with different sets of co-transcription factors, drive dissimilar transcriptional programs, and cooperate with dysregulation of disparate signaling pathways in promoting tumour formation. Accordingly, the amplification of different Myc family genes could modulate the expression patterns of medulloblastoma subgroups. Additionally, genes nearby the \gene{MYC} or \gene{MYCN} locus can modulate the effect of amplifications spanning these loci.

 While in pursuit of this long-term goal, we need to address some remaining questions regarding the classification of medulloblastoma. While anatomical location and histology will likely continue to be an integral core of \gls{cns} tumour classification, numerous other ways of categorizing cancer present the problem of choosing or appropriately integrating classification schemes. One alternative classification of medulloblastoma could be based on genetic alterations, as in many other cancer types. While some genes identify specific cancer types -- \gene{RB1} (retinoblastoma) and \gene{SMARCB1} (\gls{atrt}) -- other genes may be less useful for defining cancer types. For example, \gene{TP53} mutation or loss leads to a spectrum of tumours, and restoring TP53 function will not restore the genomic damages already incurred. Additionally, given that most observed mutations in cancer likely do not contribute to tumourigenesis, identifying and validating tumourigenic mutations may be difficult without first grouping cancers into sufficiently homogeneous subtypes. Moreover, disruption of multiple genes in the same pathway may lead to the same molecular phenotype, and it can be difficult to identify recurrently disrupted pathways prior to molecular classification \citeself{shih12}. The most problematic issue for defining medulloblastoma based on genetic alterations is the relatively low frequency of most mutations. Conversely, epigenetic profiles may reflect the cellular origin that shape the genomic landscape of the tumour, and it may be useful for the classification of medulloblastoma. Encouragingly, DNA methylation profiles define very similar subtypes as RNA expression profiles, suggesting that both may be integrated to develop a more robust molecular classification of medulloblastoma.
 
-Since medulloblastoma is now classified into four molecular subgroups, mouse models of medulloblastoma would also need to be classified into the same subgroups. Numerous mouse models purport to recapitulate a specific molecular subgroup of human medulloblastoma, \citeself{he14, chow14, northcott14, natarajan13} but the molecular subgroup of some mouse models are contested \citeref{poschl14}. Better comparative transcriptomics may therefore be needed to resolve controversies surrounding mouse models of medulloblastoma (and similarly for other cancers or diseases). We would need to move beyond mere descriptions of the conservation or divergence of transcriptional programs and attempt to draw parallels between human and mouse transcriptomes in order to more precisely identify conserved molecular mechanisms and enable specific hypotheses regarding human diseases to be tested in mouse models.

 Concurrent with ongoing scientific inquiries, the search for more effective therapy for medulloblastoma continues. With the recognition that medulloblastoma comprises four different diseases, many prospective trials are now testing emerging therapies for specific medulloblastoma subgroups, consistent with the spirit of precision medicine. For Group3 medulloblastoma, an \emph{in vitro} drug screened identified  pemetrexed and gemcitabine as a potential combination therapy, and this combination showed efficacy in mouse models of Group3 medulloblastoma (but not SHH medulloblastoma) \citeref{morfouace14}. Similarly, BET bromodomain inhibition of \gene{MYC}-amplified medulloblastoma is currently under investigation \citeref{bandopadhayay14}. For SHH medulloblastoma, SMO inhibitors (e.g. vismodegib and sonidegib) showed some efficacy and present a promising avenue for further development \citeref{kieran14, gajjar13, rodon14, amakye13}. In addition, mouse models of SHH medulloblastoma appear sensitive to inhibition of Auroa and Polo-like kinases \citeself{markant13} or inhibition of BIRC5 (survivin) \citeref{brun14}. In order to expand the arsenal of anti-cancer drugs, it may be prudent to consider administering candidate drugs before standard combination chemotherapy in future clinical trials, as precedent exists for drugs to be effective against untreated tumours but not recurrent tumours. For example, topotecan (topoisomerase inhibitor) is ineffective in recurrent medulloblastoma \citeref{kadota99, blaney96} but is effective upfront in untreated, high-risk medulloblastoma \citeref{stewart04}. In trials of novel therapy on untreated medulloblastoma, salvage treatment with chemotherapy should of course be planned so that patient survival is not compromised; furthermore, prior trials on replacing radiotherapy with chemotherapy would provide invaluable insight for planning salvage treatments. Past clinical experiences and novel scientific knowledge will together help usher in a new era of medulloblastoma treatment based on individualized targeted therapy that enhances the quality of care and preserves the quality of life for the patients.
