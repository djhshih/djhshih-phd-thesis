\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my advisors, Michael and Gary, for all their support and guidance throughout my studies. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of my thesis committee -- Dr.\ Meredith Irwin, Dr.\ Quaid Morris -- for their insightful inputs. I would also like to acknowledge all my labmates for their help and feedback. Most of all, I wish to thank Paul Northcott for his contribution to our collaborative pursuits.

I must thank all members of the Medulloblastoma Advanced Genomics Consortium for their contributions, without which the studies described herein would not be possible. I am especially thankful for work done by Dr.\ Andrey Korshunov, Dr.\ Stefan Pfister, and their teams at the German Cancer Research Center.

I would also like to thank all my teachers who imparted to me invaluable knowledge and expertise. I especially thank Dr.\ Derek Corneil, Dr.\ Geoffrey Hinton, Dr.\ Boris Steipe, and Dr.\ Reinhold Vieth at the University of Toronto. I would also like to highlight Massive Open Online Courses offered by Stanford University, Coursera, and edX, as well as course notes graciously made openly available by instructors at other institutions. I owe a debt of gratitude to inspirational teachers such as Dr.\ Andrew Ng (Stanford University), Dr.\ Daphne Koller (Stanford University), Dr.\ Robert Pich\'{e} (Tampere University of Technology), Dr.\ Brain Caffo (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health), Dr.\ Rafael Irizarry (Harvard School of Public Health), and Dr.\ Tom Mitchell (Carnegie Mellon University).

I am grateful to open source software communities for openly sharing their work, including authors, contributors, and maintainers on CRAN, Bioconductor, PyPI, GitHub, and numerous other repositories. Their spirit of openness is infectious.

This work is supported by the Frederick Banting and Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship, the Michael Smith Foreign Study Supplement, the Ontario Graduate Scholarship, and the University of Toronto Fellowship.
