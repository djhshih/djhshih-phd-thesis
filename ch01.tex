\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

One in 285 children are diagnosed with cancer before the age of 20 \citeref{ward14}, and cancer is the second leading cause of death in children \citeref{murphy13}. Owing to advances in treatment, the 5-year survival of children with cancer has steadily increased from 63\% in 1975 to 85\% in 2006 \citeref{howlader14}. The improvements in survival, however, vary considerably across cancer types. In 1975, the 5-year survival rates for childhood leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour were 50\% and 57\%, respectively. In 2006, the survival rate for the former reached 87\% while the latter lagged behind at 74\% \citeref{howlader14}. Leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour are biologically very different types of cancer: they arise from different cells within different organs, hijack different cellular signaling programs to effect uncontrolled proliferation, and reside in different locations that permit different accessibilities to treatment. It should come as no surprise then that leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour respond differently to similar anti-cancer treatments (consisting of chemotherapy and radiotherapy). Furthermore, leukemia and \gls{cns} tumour can each be classified into additional cancer subtypes, which also response varyingly to treatment. Within leukemias, the 5-year patient survival of acute lymphocytic leukemia is 92\% and that of acute myelogenous leukemia is 66\% \citeref{howlader14}. Within \gls{cns} tumours, the 5-year patient survival of pilocytic astrocytoma is 94\% and that of medulloblastoma is 72\% \citeref{ostrom14}. Indeed, the responses of cancers to therapy depend on not only the affected tissue (blood vs. \gls{cns}) but also the cellular origin (lymphoid vs. myeloid and astrocytic vs. embryonal). Using anatomical locations and cellular appearance, clinicians classify cancer into different types in order to predict the responses to treatment. Current post-surgical treatment modalities function largely through one predominant mechanism (inhibiting cellular division and inducing apoptosis), but novel anti-cancer therapies are increasing in specificity against aberrant cells and diverging in mechanisms of action. Accordingly, the classification of cancer will become increasingly important for selecting the right treatment for each patient.

While the current classification of cancer using the primary site of occurrence and the morphology of the cell have been useful for predicting patient response, the advent of molecular profiling and sequencing technologies can refine this classification further and facilitate the development of therapies targeted against specific aberrations within a cancer. Currently, the \gls{who} classify \gls{cns} tumours into 86 distinct entities based primarily on histological appearance \citeref{who07}. (In 1993, \gls{who} recognized only 36 subtypes of \gls{cns} tumours \citeref{kleihues93}.) Despite this detailed level of classification, the 5-year survival of children with \gls{cns} tumours has remained stagnant at about 75\% since 1996 \citeref{howlader14}. The discrepancy between discovery of new \gls{cns} tumour histotypes and the lack of therapeutic improvement suggest that the histological classification of \gls{cns} tumours may be insufficient to identify biologically similar tumours and facilitate the development of novel effective therapy. In particular, it was noted as early as 1971 that medulloblastoma with desmoplastic histology exhibits longer patient survival \citeref{chatty71} in response to radiotherapy; however, it remains unclear why the desmoplastic phenotype is associated with longer survival or which novel therapeutic agent may be effective against this histological variant. In comparison, a medulloblastoma tumour with a loss-of-function mutation in \gene{PTCH1} (endogenous suppressor of \gls{shh} signaling) would depend on hyperactive \gls{shh} signaling for growth, the tumour would therefore be expected to --- and indeed does --- respond to inhibition of \gls{shh} signaling \citeref{rudin09}. Accordingly, characterizing the genetic mutations and understanding the biology of a tumour can help guide the discovery of novel therapies and the selection of suitable treatments. 

In order to identify cancer mutations against which therapeutic intervention may be beneficial, we would need to distinguish between mutations contribute to tumourigenesis (known as \emph{driver} mutations) from those that do not (known as \emph{passenger} mutations). Cancer cells accumulate somatic mutations by having disrupted DNA damage response or DNA repair pathways. Somatic mutations generally occur stochastically (with some exceptions including antibody diversification by activation-induced cytidine deaminase). Most mutations in a cancer cell would thus be deletarious or neutral to the cell, and mutations that confer selective advantage would increase in \emph{cellular frequency} (proportion of cells habouring mutation) within a tumour. Not all mutations observed at high cellular frequency, however, contribute to tumourigenesis. Since multiple mutations may occur each time a cancer cell replicate its DNA and multiple cell divisions may occur before a new driver mutation arises, a population of cancer cells arising from the same parental cell will share one driver mutation and many additional mutations that do not contribute to tumourigenesis. Additionally, not all driver mutations become clonal (i.e. reach 100\% cellular frequency) due to interaction among cells. In glioblastoma multiforme, cancer cells expressing mutant EGFR promote the growth of cells expressing wild-type EGFR \citeref{inda10}; hence, the tumour heterogeneity is sustained by this paracrine mechanism and the \gene{EGFR} mutation does not become clonal. Taking these possibilities into consideration, high cellular frequency is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a mutation to be a driver. Instead, a robust method for distinguish driver from passenger mutations would be to assess its \emph{recurrence frequency}: the frequency that a mutation is observed across samples. If a mutation drives tumour formation, we would expect to find across multiple tumours from different patients, provided that the tumours are biologically similar and arise through similar molecular mechanisms. To use recurrence frequency as a criteria for identifying driver mutations, we would need to first classify the tumours into homogeneous groups.

This thesis will focus on medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumour occuring in the cerebellum and the posterior fossa. \gls{who} classifies medulloblastoma as a grade IV embryonal tumour \citeref{who07}. The diagnosis of medulloblastoma is made by the anatomical location of the tumour and histological morphology of the cells. Medulloblastoma used to be a universally fatal disease; today, 58\% of patients are expected to live longer than 15 years \citeref{ward14}. To predict whether a patient will respond favourably to treatment, clinicians currently categorize medulloblastoma by such features as metastatic presentation and histological variants. Medulloblastoma may be divided into classic, desmoplastic, and anaplastic (large cell) histotypes. While this histological classification of medulloblastoma provides some prognostic value, it provide scant insight into potential biological mechanisms. Instead, several studies generated RNA expression profiles of primary medulloblastoma tumours using microarrays and sought to characterize medulloblastoma by patterns of RNA expression. Since each expression profile captures a snapshot of the overall molecular state of a tumour, biologically similar tumours exhibit similar expression profiles. Therefore, tumours with similar expression profiles can be clustered (grouped) together to discover (relatively) homogeneous molecular classes. By these clustering analyses, four molecular classes (henceforth known as \emph{subgroups}) of medulloblastoma were discovered: WNT, SHH, Group~3, and Group~4 \citeref{taylor12, northcott11a, kool12, remke11, cho11}. As the names suggest, WNT medulloblastoma have hyperactive \gls{wnt} signaling and SHH medullobalstoma have increased \gls{shh} signaling compared to the other subgroups, while Group~3 and Group~4 are less well defined \citeref{northcott11a, kool12, cho11}. We hypothesize that classifying medulloblastoma into these molecular subgroups will shed light on its cancer biology and consequently improve prediction of treatment response and point to novel therapeutic targets.


\section{Epidemiology}

Medulloblastoma occurs at an incidence of 4.1 per 1~000~000 children under 20, ranking as the most common type of brain tumour in childhood \citeref{ostrom14}.

\section{Genetic predisposition}

Genetic disorder	mutated gene	medulloblastoma
basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin's syndrome)	PTCH1, PTCH2,  SUFU	SHH
DICER1 syndrome	DICER1
Nijmegen breakage syndrome	NBN
Turcot's syndrome	APC	WNT
Fanconi anemia	BRCA2
Li-Fraumeni	TP53
neurofibromatosis type 1 (Von Recklinghausen's disease)	NF1
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome	CREBBP
Fragile X	FMR1
ataxia telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome)	ATM

\gls{atrt} and medulloblastoma are similar by histology\citeref{utsuki03}, and by \gls{mri} \citeref{koral08}.
SMARCB1 (hSNF5/INI) mutation is indicative of \gls{atrt} instead of medulloblastoma \citeref{biegel00,kraus02}.

\section{Histological classification}



\section{Molecular classification}

We contend that the classifying medullobalstoma into subtypes with similar molecular biology can help distinguish tumourigenic (cancer promoting) from non-tumourigenic mutations and thereby facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets. 

\section{Molecular biology}


\section{Current and potential treatments}

Current therapy for medulloblastoma --- including surgical resection, radiation of the entire brain and spinal cord, and aggressive chemotherapy --- yields five-year survival rates of 60-70\% \citeref{gajjar06}. Survivors are often left with significant neurological, intellectual, and physical disabilities secondary to the effects of these non-specific, cytotoxic therapies on the developing nervous system \citeref{spiegler04,mabbott05}.

Recent evidence suggests that medulloblastoma in fact comprises a group of biologically distinct molecular entities whose clinical and genetic differences may require separate therapeutic strategies \citeref{thompson06,kool08,northcott11a,remke11,cho11}. Four principal subgroups\citeref{taylor12} of medulloblastoma have been identified: WNT, SHH, Group~3, and Group~4, and there is preliminary evidence for clinically significant subdivisions of the subgroups \citeref{northcott11a,cho11,remke11,taylor12,northcott11b}. Targeted therapies based on the genetics of the disease are not currently in use. However, inhibitors of the \gls{shh} pathway activator, smoothened, have shown some early evidence of efficacy \citeref{rudin09}. With a deeper understanding of the genomics and biology of medulloblastoma subgroups, we hope to herald a new era of medulloblastoma treatment based on selective, specific, targeted therapy.

Molecular subgroups are reproduced by collaborators.
Attempt at molecular classification is not novel. Classification of \gls{cnspnet} is not very robust \citeself{li09}.
Sometimes it helps guide diagnosis \citeself{merino15}.

\section{Research objectives}

My study will focus on the following three obstacles that hinders the development of targeted therapy against medulloblastoma molecular subgroups:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The lack of a clinically applicable assay for molecular subgrouping of medulloblastoma.
	\item The paucity of actionable targets for WNT, Group~3, and Group~4 medulloblastomas.
	\item Current clinical prognostication of medulloblastoma does not consider molecular subgroups.
\end{enumerate}

The objectives of my study are to provide viable solutions to these issues and to demonstrate the clinical significance of molecular classification.


\subsection*{Aim I: Molecular classification of medulloblastoma in clinical contexts}

Although the retrospective classification of medulloblastoma has been scientifically informative, molecular subgrouping has not been applied in the context of a prospective clinical trial. One major obstacle is the lack of fresh-frozen samples for most clinical cases. Expression profiling, on which molecular classification was based, depends on the availability of high-quality RNA. In contrast, clinical samples are routinely subjected to formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding, which preserves tissue integrity but causes nucleic acid degradation. To facilitate the development of therapy specifically targeted against molecular subgroups, we sought to establish an molecular subgrouping assay that can be clinically applied on \gls{ffpe} samples. I have established an analytic pipeline to molecular subgrouping using expression data generated by nanoString assays, and demonstrated its high classification accuracy on \gls{ffpe} samples \citeself{northcott12}. To further make the assay clinically applicable, I have implemented several quality-control measures that identify cases which cannot be reliably assigned molecular subgroup, due to poor specimen quality or assay reaction failure.

\subsection*{Aim II: Target identification by copy-number profiling of medulloblastoma}

After having established a clinically applicable molecular classification methodology, I turned to the problem of identifying molecular targets in medulloblastoma. Unlike SHH medulloblastomas, actionable targets for WNT, Group~3, and Group~4 tumours have yet been identified. However, prior attempts may have been underpowered to discriminate the genomic differences among the four molecular subgroups. To this end, the \gls{magic}, consisting of scientists and physicians from 43 cities across the globe, has gathered $>1200$ medulloblastomas. Paul Northcott and I have analyzed the genomic copy-number profiles of the tumours by \gls{snp} arrays. We have identified genes and pathways that characterize each medulloblastoma subgroup \citeself{shih12}.


\subsection*{Aim III: Clinical prognostication within medulloblastoma subgroups}

Prior clinical prognostication studies in medulloblastoma have identified biomarkers without discriminating between the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. Given that medulloblastoma subgroups are biologically and molecular distinct disease entities, we hypothesized that incorporating molecular subgroup into prognostication can enhance the accuracy of survival prediction and improve the reliability of risk stratification. Practical and reliable identification of risk could allow for therapy intensification in high-risk children to improve survival and therapy de-escalation in low-risk children to avoid complications of therapy. By identifying clinical and molecular biomarkers within medulloblastoma subgroups, I have designed risk stratification schemes for SHH, Group~3, and Group~4 medulloblastoma that can achieve unpredented levels of prognostic accuracy.
